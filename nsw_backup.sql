367	2020-11-23 14:49:28	\N	\N	\N	<p>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away (Jn. 20:15)</p><p>Some of my fondest memories as a child were going to my Mamaw and Papaw Lindsey’s house on Sunset Avenue in Bloomington, Indiana. They were two of the greatest people I’ve ever known. Hardworking, faithful and loving. The two of them worked side by side at RCA’s factory, where they retired together. The two of them were multi-talented and could do anything, at least in my mind they could. They showcased some their talents in the garden in their midsize yard. When I was a child it seemed like that garden was huge. They grew cucumbers, tomatoes, green beans and anything else you can think of. It seems like yesterday that we were in that garden picking beans and tomatoes. Mamaw had these two buckets and she’d fill one of them up with fresh picked beans, then we’d break beans and put them in the other bucket. My sisters and myself would break beans with Papaw while Mamaw either fixed us fried green tomato sandwiches, or a homemade pizza. After lunch we were back out in the garden working, or playing yard darts. I miss them dearly, and wish my daughter could have met them and experienced that garden and their love.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>From the moment we are introduced to God in Genesis we read that He is multi-talented. He was the Creator of the world and mankind. He would be Adam’s surgeon, Eve’s maker, and a matchmaker, escorting Eve down the garden’s path to her husband. Along with these divine accomplishments, God was a gardener: “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom He had formed” (Gen. 2:8).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h1>God the Gardener</h1><p>Eden wasn’t the garden. Rather, God planted a garden in the east of Eden. There in the garden the Lord made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food (Gen. 2:9a). The phrase “grow” or “spring up” in the Hebrew means to “sprout” to “cause to grow.” The Lord planted the seed, and it sprouted. Everything that God plants grows. If God plants the seed, then rest assured then it will come to pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The Tree of Life was in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (Gen. 2:9b). God the gardener planted and cultivated everything with intention and purpose.</p><p>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers &#8211; Pishon, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates. The river which flowed from Eden is a type of the gospel and how it flows through the garden of the church and is distributed through the preaching and witnessing of believers to the four corners of the earth. Every nation and people are watered from gospel streams (Ezekiel 47).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h1>Adam the Gardener</h1><blockquote><p>“And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (Gen. 2:15–17).</p></blockquote><p>The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to dress it and keep it. To “dress” the garden meant to cultivate it. Plowing and working the garden became Adam’s responsibility within the garden. To “keep” the garden was to protect it and maintain it. In other words, Adam, the image-bearer of God, was to become a gardener. The garden was a place of worship and work. Adam had a praise on a lips, and a plow in his hand. He was to praise, plow, and protect. Man’s responsibility is still to worship and work for his Creator, while contending for the faith once delivered to the saints (Jude 3).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After God placed man in the garden to dress it and keep it, He gave man detailed instructions for the two trees. The Tree of Life was graciously given, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was prohibited. The Tree of Life is symbolic of God’s grace, which is given to believers in Jesus Christ. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is representative of God’s law, which cannot be fulfilled without the enabling power of God’s Spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It wasn’t good that man should be alone, therefore, God made a helper for Adam. The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man (Gen. 2:21-22).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Together they were to be fruitful and multiply while having dominion over God’s garden.</p><h1>A Garden Snake</h1><p>Every garden has its pests, and I can remember being frozen with fear the day Mamaw told me of the possibility of garden snakes. Eden’s garden had a pest too. The serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. History’s first question was a full-blown attack on God’s Word: “Did God actually say ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” Eve’s mind was as twisted as a vine. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil caught her attention and its fruit incited within her a lust for power. Adam and his new bride ate the fruit and their eyes were opened. Ashamed with the realization they had been naked all this time, they hurried to make aprons out of fig leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The two of them hid themselves among the trees of the garden when they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden. The Gardener called out to his husbandman and wife, “Where are you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Adam and Eve came out from behind the trees and revealed their inadequate covering. “This woman whom you gave to be with me, she made me eat the fruit from the tree” said Adam. “The garden snake deceived me, and I ate” said Eve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Paradise was lost. Adam and Eve were cursed with sin and suffering. The serpent was promised a date with judgment. Worst of all, the Lord God drove the man out of the garden, and placed an angel to guard the tree of life. The ground was cursed, and Adam would have to painfully work to remove the thorns and thistles to have even a little bit of a harvest.</p><h1>The Gardener’s Son</h1><p>Wrapped up in the judgement of Adam’s sin, was a seed of a promise. “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Gen. 3:15). The ground, the serpent, the man and the woman might be cursed, but God’s seed is never cursed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Therefore, the seed of God’s promise began to sprout. The apostle Paul wrote, “The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven” (1 Cor. 15:47). The seed of the woman, is the Second Adam, come down from heaven. The God-Man is the Gardener’s Son. He came to do what the first Adam couldn’t. He came to restore the lost Paradise.</p><p>Adam was “sent forth” from the garden. The Hebrew word for “sent forth” is “garash” and means to “expel” or “kick out.” It is interesting that when Mark recorded the temptation of Jesus, he chose a comparative Greek work to “garash.” Mark said, “And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness” (Mk. 1:12). The Greek verb for “driveth” is “ekballo” which means “expel” or “drive out.” The first Adam was kicked out for his failure to endure temptation. The Second Adam, Jesus Christ, came to relive Adam’s temptation, but instead of failing, He succeeded. We should note that Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights, and like Adam, He was tempted of the devil to eat (Matt. 4:1-3).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Here was the Gardener’s Son. He spoke of sowing seed on the wayside, on rocky, thorny, and good ground (Matt. 13:18-23). He employed stories about weeds and wheat (Matt. 13:24-30). He shared stories of treasures hidden in fields (Matt. 13:44). He even declared that He was the Vine, and His Father was the Vinedresser (Jn. 15:1-17). Through the simplicity of speaking He could even curse fig trees causing them to wither and die (Matt. 21:18-22).</p><p>Where was the Gardener’s Son the night before His death? Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. Prayer is the great deterrent to temptation (Matt. 26:41). Adam succumbed to temptation at the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and realized he was naked. Jesus triumphed over temptation and His accusers stripped Him naked and to hang Him in open shame on Calvary’s tree. One tree in the garden brought death to the world, and another tree brought life to the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Once Jesus had died on Calvary’s tree, His body was taken and laid in a tomb in a garden. In God’s superior plan, after Paradise was lost, it was regained when God took up the vocation of gardening once more. Mary Magadelene went to the tomb early, but seen that the stone of the tomb had been rolled away. She looked into the tomb and seen two angels. Unlike Eden’s cherub, they couldn’t keep the Second Adam in or out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Jesus asked, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” She supposed this man who was speaking with her was the gardener. Beloved, she was correct!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The same Lord God who planted a garden in Eden had now planted life in the soil above an empty tomb.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Beloved, the Gardener has come to give you life. Jesus has come to cultivate the life of the Spirit within us, to cause us to bear spiritual fruit (Jn. 15:1-17; Gal. 5:22). For we are God’s fellow workers, His husbandry, and field (1 Cor. 3:9). Furthermore, as God’s gardeners, we are to expand His Kingdom by being fruitful and multiplying. Beloved, Jesus has come to feed us graciously from the Tree of Life. He will say to us one day, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Lk. 23:43).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>	100	\N	Supposing Him to be the Gardener	\N	/EBE546E8-1484-42F4-87EA-7EC36B267D17.jpeg

Judah had lost their way and a generation was about to be taken into captivity. It seems modern preaching is doing much of the same. The prosperity, and health and wealth gospel offer a false peace that only disguises captivity. </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="951gj-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="951gj-0-0"><span data-offset-key="951gj-0-0"> </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="2u6k5-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="2u6k5-0-0"><span data-offset-key="2u6k5-0-0">With a generation that faced opposition, carnality, idolatry and false hope, God spoke through His prophet Jeremiah and told them this: “Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.

When they were to arrive at crossroads, the moment called for clear decision (v.16). To go one way can mean death; to go another, life. What looked outdated, and outmoded was in fact the path they were to take. To return to God is to take the path that leads to God. </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="7bmq7-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="7bmq7-0-0"><span data-offset-key="7bmq7-0-0"> </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="5hcui-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="5hcui-0-0"><span data-offset-key="5hcui-0-0">Notice the verbs in this message: stand, see, ask, walk and rest. </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="35rlf-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="35rlf-0-0"><span data-offset-key="35rlf-0-0"> </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="dn2tl" data-offset-key="3ra9o-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="3ra9o-0-0"><span data-offset-key="3ra9o-0-0">Stand!

366	2020-12-11 17:52:36	2025-03-22 22:53:20.393		posts/views/templates/default.html.got	<p>What a year, huh? Hopefully you read several books during the shutdowns and quarantines. I was fortunate to read around 35 books during 2020. Not as many as I wanted to read, but still a pretty good amount. Here are the top ten books I read this year.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. Tethered to the Cross: The Life and Preaching of Charles H. Spurgeon by Thomas Breimaier</h2><p>You may not know this, but I’m a huge Charles Spurgeon fan. I’ve read many of his biographies and most of his autobiography. There isn’t much that I don’t know about Spurgeon. With that said, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tethered-Cross-Preaching-Charles-Spurgeon/dp/0830853308/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1JWL3XER4WAJ8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=tethered+to+the+cross&amp;qid=1607706565&amp;sprefix=tethered+to+the%2Caps%2C243&amp;sr=8-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Breimaier’s offering on Spurgeon</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"> </span>opened my eyes to the amazing gospel work that Spurgeon accomplished. Spurgeon’s vision of Jesus Christ’s work at Calvary shaped the way he did ministry. From preaching and writing, to launching a college for pastors and even opening an orphanage. If you’re looking to have your passion ignited for the gospel, then start here.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing by Robert Caro</h2><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Robert-Caro/dp/0525656340/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1A9M2PW35TKDU&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=robert+caro+working&amp;qid=1607706680&amp;sprefix=robert+caro%2Caps%2C311&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Robert Caro</a> is a highly recognized biographer. His four volume biography of President Lyndon Johnson is the stuff of legend. <em>Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing</em> is a peak behind the curtain of how he works. It’s more than that, however. Along the way he offers more biographical information about President Johnson, and casts more light on New York’s power broker Robert Moses. This will be one of my favorite books on writing for a long time.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike by Phil Knight</h2><p>I couldn’t put down <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike/dp/1501135929/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CUKTC71X3ZFB&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=shoe+dog&amp;qid=1607706747&amp;sprefix=shoe+dog%2Caps%2C697&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Phil Knight’s memoir</a> about starting Nike. If you are interested in how an empire like Nike is created, then I highly recommend this book. Knight’s adventure from being an amateur runner in college, to changing the shoe game will fascinate you.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear by Elizabeth Gilbert</h2><p>Elizabeth Gilbert is a bestselling author. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=big+magic+elizabeth+gilbert&amp;qid=1607626696&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B</a><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=big+magic+elizabeth+gilbert&amp;qid=1607626696&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ig Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear </a></em>she offers insight into the creative life. It was so well-written that I read it in just a few days.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>5. Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier</h2><p>Don’t read this one in the dark. You might even want to avoid reading it alone. Because its terrifying. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arguments-Deleting-Social-Media-Accounts/dp/1250239087/ref=sr_1_1?crid=247X1GYNKG4Q3&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=ten+arguments+for+deleting+your+social+media+accounts&amp;qid=1607706632&amp;sprefix=ten+argu%2Caps%2C539&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Lanier</a>, we are no longer the consumers, we are the product. Lanier was one of the early masterminds behind social networking, therefore, he knows what’s going on behind the scenes. Dr. Frankenstein cried out, “It’s alive!” when the monster he created came alive. The creators of social media are starting to realize the monster they created is alive, and there may not be a weapon to kill it, other than deleting it altogether. The social media monster is exposing the monsters in all of us, and its terrifying.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>6. David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants by Malcolm Gladwell</h2><p>I tend to read anything Malcolm Gladwell writes. Though this is an older work, I finally had a chance to read it. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204374/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3EATI7X3IOWW7&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=david+and+goliath+malcolm+gladwell&amp;qid=1607707065&amp;sprefix=david+and+golia%2Caps%2C311&amp;sr=8-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">David and Goliath</a>, in my opinion, is Gladwell’s more inspiring books. He pulls stories from history to show how people have overcome crazy circumstances. Another invigorating work from Gladwell.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>7. Adorning the Dark: Thoughts on Community, Calling, and the Mystery of Making by Andrew Peterson</h2><p>This year I read several books on the topic of the creative life. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adorning-Dark-Thoughts-Community-Calling/dp/1535949023/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2O8O8TCLG6FQ5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=adorning+the+dark+andrew+peterson&amp;qid=1607707392&amp;sprefix=adorning+th%2Caps%2C305&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Peterson</a> unpacks what it means to be a creative while being a Christian. He’s a writer, musician and songwriter. I just really enjoyed Peterson’s writing and the vulnerability he displayed while putting to words what its like to struggle and succeed as a creative.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>8. Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on it by Chris Voss</h2><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-audiobook/dp/B01COR1GM2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2D2UXQZ3LFCGN&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=never+split+the+difference&amp;qid=1607707526&amp;sprefix=never+%2Caps%2C270&amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Chris Voss</a> was the FBI’s top hostage negotiator. In this fun and exciting book, Voss serves up some amazing tricks and tips on how to negotiate anything. I have to admit, I’ve used several of Voss’s tricks since reading it.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>9. The 5AM Club: Own Your Morning. Elevate Your Life by Robin Sharma</h2><p>I started 2020 really well. I woke up consistently at 5:30am. I was running and exercising six days a week. Then came March and the shutdowns. It was like my motivation was just zapped through the spring and summer. I needed a good kick in the pants to end the year and look towards 2021. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-5-AM-Club-Robin-Sharma-audiobook/dp/B07KRM53PR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2V6FAS5OG90DP&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+5am+club&amp;qid=1607707906&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=the+5am%2Caudible%2C485&amp;sr=1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Robin Sharma’s book</a> has been on my list for awhile, and I finally picked it up and read it in like three days. This isn’t your normal motivational book. It’s written in story form, so the valuable information is shrouded in narrative. At first I was little unsure of the form, but the next thing I knew I had about finished, and had marked up nearly every page. This is a really good book that I’ll be reading more than once.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>10. Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes: Removing Cultural Blinders to Better Understand the Bible by E. Randolph Richards and Brandon O’Brien</h2><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Misreading-Scripture-Western-Eyes-Understand/dp/B00OHZZIM4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FB078SFQ26SD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=misreading+scripture+with+western+eyes&amp;qid=1607708294&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=misread%2Caudible%2C238&amp;sr=1-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">This is a dangerous book</a>. It’s the kind of book that I’d like to give every preacher, missionary, and Bible reader. But I know it would seriously mess up their misinterpreting of the Bible. It would either help them or harden them. It would help them to see that you can’t read today’s headlines into the Bible. It would help them to see that certain cultural standards of the last fifty years cannot be considered biblical. Or it could have the opposite effect, it could cause them to be like Pharaoh and refuse to listen despite the obvious signs. If you’re serious about rightly dividing the Word of God, and correctly interpreting Scripture in its original context, then I recommend this book. It’s a good introduction to Biblical interpretation. Just be careful, it might help reveal the truth of God’s Word, and that’s dangerous for a lot of Christians.</p><p>There you have it.

369	2020-11-10 20:53:12	\N	\N	\N	<p>John MacArthur is a prolific writer and editor. His continuous ability to publish theological works is quite astonishing. In 2018 he released his own systematic theology with Crossway publishers.</p><p>Let me say at the outset, that I don&#8217;t agree wholeheartedly with MacArthur&#8217;s theological persuasion, and I&#8217;m more than positive he disagrees with my corner of the theological map. With that said, I have been a supporter of MacArthur&#8217;s works. I agree with his high view of God, Scripture, sin, Jesus Christ, and holiness. Biblical Doctrine allows him to further develop those ideas of which I agree, and to unpack his theological persuasions that I don&#8217;t agree with.</p><p>The most enjoyable part of this work was the Prolegomena, which is a Greek word for &#8220;prologue.&#8221; Most readers skip a book&#8217;s prologue and introduction and jump into the main contents. However, there is rich doctrine in MacArthur&#8217;s prologue in Biblical Doctrine. I thoroughly enjoyed MacArthur&#8217;s explanation of theology, and the reasoning for studying theology. For one to undertake reading such a large book as Biblical Doctrine (coming in a whopping 1,023 pages), you need to understand what theology is and why you should read and study it. Then you&#8217;ll need to know the differences between the various disciplines in theological study, which MacArthur explains succinctly.</p><p>Each section is broken down into smaller more digestible chapters covering a plethora of theological topics. Wayne Grudem&#8217;s Systematic Theology, in my opinion, is the most inviting and readable systematic theology available, while MacArthur&#8217;s Biblical Doctrine could be considered a close companion.</p><p>I&#8217;d highly recommend MacArthur&#8217;s Biblical Doctrine for those looking to familiarize themselves with theological studies. With that said, I&#8217;d be sure to have a solid footing of what you believe before undertaking the herculean task of reading MacArthur&#8217;s systematic theology and coming into contact with MacArthur&#8217;s flavor of Reformed Theology.</p><p><em>*Crossway Publishers graciously gave me a digital copy of MacArthur&#8217;s Biblical Doctrine: A Systematic Summary of Bible Truth for my honest review.</em></p>	100	\N	Book Review: Biblical Doctrine by John MacArthur &#038; Richard Mayhue	\N	/Image-11-10-20-at-2.30-PM-2.jpg
370	2020-11-03 00:36:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>Imagine the process of creating an idol. A tree from a forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman. Portion of the wood is molded and shaped into a design. Next, the newly formed idol is decorated with silver and gold, fastened to the wood so that it cannot move. Unfortunately, the idol cannot speak, for it doesn’t have a mouth. Additionally, it has to be carried, for it cannot walk under its own power.</p><p>Now, here’s the absurdity. The person who cut down the tree, formed the wood into an idol, and decorated it with their hard-earned silver and gold turns around and worships it. The god they are worshiping was created with their own hands! The worshiper claims the god they just devised and created is the Creator. They pray to it, asking for it to work miracles. But the idol cannot speak. It can’t even move. The worshiper has more power and ability than the idol.</p><p>Do you see how utterly foolish worshiping idols is? That’s exactly what Judah had done (Jer. 10:1-16). They had cut down trees, formed idols, and decorated the idols with silver and gold. Then they had the audacity to worship the idols they had created. Judah attempted to create their happiness, while refusing to worship the True God who created the trees, silver and gold.</p><p>Judah’s self-made idols were their ruin, not their remedy. Likewise, trusting in anything other than Jesus is futile. Putting your faith in things like money or governments is hollow. Those are man-made things. They are unable to do what only God can do. Governments can crumble. Money can lose its value. They can’t answer your prayers, nor can’t fulfill your deepest longings. The same goes for relationships, sex, careers, beauty, and health. All of them have been created by God, but they aren’t God. In other words, you can’t create your own happiness. Only the True God can bring true satisfaction.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Jeremiah 10-13	\N	/38227676-FD9F-4076-90F5-6F5837A2E40D.jpeg

The prophets and priests had only superficially healed the people. The Lord said, “For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace” (Jer. 8:11). Jeremiah lamented, “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved” (Jer. 8:20). The wounds of Judah’s sin were exposed and far from healing.</p><p>Jeremiah asked the people, “Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?” Gilead was the land just east of the Jordan River, only about 60-70 miles away from Judah. Gilead’s name meant “hill of witness” for it was a mountainous and rocky terrain. It was also known for its various resins found in its local balsam trees. These resins were used for fragrances and balms for healing wounds. Yes, there was a balm for Judah’s physical wounds available just a short distance away in Gilead. Likewise, there was a balm within reach for Judah’s sin – repentance and God’s mercy. That’s all they would need to heal the wounds of their sin.</p><p>Beloved, there is a balm for our sin. There is a healing treatment for our open wounds, and it is found in a tree located on Mount Calvary. The sacrifice at Calvary was a sweet fragrance in the nostrils of God (Eph. 5:2).</p><p>There at Calvary’s tree, healing is found in the precious blood of Jesus. Healing is just within your reach. Restoration is just a few steps away. Reconciliation is within your grasp. Just believe in Jesus and repent of your sins. Be buried with Christ in baptism, and receive His empowering Spirit, to be made whole.</p>	100	1	Daily Readings in the Bible Jeremiah 7-9		/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ecclesiastes-5-8-150x150.png
374	2020-10-09 11:26:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>The prophet Jeremiah ministered to the people of Judah during the reign of king Josiah until after Babylon’s destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. Some have called Jeremiah the “weeping prophet” due to his emotional messages of God’s judgment concerning Judah. Jeremiah didn’t just prophesy of Judah’s demise, he lived through it. Judah’s refusal to listen Jeremiah’s messages was just as devastating as its eventual destruction.</p><p>Like Israel in the north, Judah had forsaken the Lord to worship false gods. The Lord said, “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water” (Jer. 2:13). By forsaking the Lord, Judah had left the fountain of living waters, and went after broken cisterns.</p><p>The people of the Ancient Near East would make cisterns to hold water. The cisterns could be pear shaped bottles, or a holes dug in the ground lined with stones. The cisterns would be filled with runoff water from a rooftop, or a similar source. The water itself would become contaminated from sitting in the cistern, breeding bacteria and germs. Therefore, the water from the cistern wasn’t fresh and wasn’t fit for drinking unless it was purified.</p><p>The Lord compared Judah’s backsliding to choosing broken cisterns which held no water. This was opposed to drinking from fresh fountain waters. Beloved, when we choose the world and sin, it’s like drinking contaminated water. What’s worse, is that this contaminated water is held in broken cisterns, leaving you always wanting more, but never having enough.</p><p>Jesus Christ will always satisfy. He is the Fountain of Living Water, quenching the thirst of every soul (Jn. 7:37-39).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Jeremiah 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Jeremiah-1-3.png
375	2020-10-08 12:36:02	\N	\N	\N	<p>The word “righteous” or “righteousness” appears throughout the Bible. God is considered to be a righteous God whose actions are righteous and just (Ps. 35:24;28; 85:10-13). The prophet Jeremiah wrote that God would be called the “The Lord our Righteousness” (Jer. 23:6; 33:16).</p><p>The word “righteousness” describes a recognized state or standard. God is ultimate standard of righteousness. He is without morally pure and without sin. His actions with creation and human beings are righteous and just. Righteousness for humans, on the other hand, means to be made right with God, or to have “right standing” with Him.</p><p>The issue with our self-proclaimed righteousness is that its inferior to God’s. Isaiah wrote, “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away” (Isaiah 64:6). God considers our righteousness to be an unclean rag.</p><p>Thankfully, we do not have to rely upon our own righteousness. God will impute His righteousness to us. Not on the basis of our works or efforts, but on the basis of Jesus Christ who was lived obediently, perfectly, and righteously on our behalf. “This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe” (Rom. 3:22). Jesus took our unrighteousness, and gave us His perfect righteousness, in that we can have right standing with God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 64-66	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-64-66.png
376	2020-10-03 20:11:09	\N	\N	\N	<p>The apostle Paul asks what can separate us from the love of God (Rom. 8:38-39). Death, life, angels, principalities, powers, height, depth, or creature can shall be able to separate us from God’s love. And Paul is correct, none of those things can separate us from the love of God.</p><p>But there was one thing that could separate us from the love of God. Isaiah says, “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, that he will not hear” (Isa. 59:1-2).</p><p>Iniquities and sin created a barricade between God and His people. It caused sinful humanity to run towards evil, swift to shed innocent blood, and to forsake justice (Isa. 53:7-8). This awful barrier lead man to grown for salvation. Unfortunately, there was nothing man could do to save himself, so it was God who would bring salvation to sinners (Isa. 59:16).</p><p>Therefore, God came to do what man could not do. By God’s own right hand, He brought salvation. He broke down the awful barrier of sin that separated humanity from Himself. Life and death couldn’t stop Him. Angels couldn’t stop Him. Principalities and powers couldn’t stop Him. Height and depth couldn’t stop Him. Creation couldn’t even stop Him.</p><p>There was only one thing that could stop Him, and that was sin. But God wouldn’t even allow that to stop Him from saving humanity. God robed Himself in flesh, battled every force and temptation, and was unscathed by sin’s defilement (Heb. 4:15). He who knew no sin, became sin that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21)!</p><p>Nothing would stand in God’s way of pursuing humanity’s salvation.

469	2020-05-23 02:02:15	\N	\N	\N	<p>Solomon prayed at the dedication of the Temple. At the conclusion of his prayer, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. The priests couldn’t enter into the Temple, due to the glory of the Lord. The children of Israel bowed down in reverence and worship at the sight of the fire and the glory.</p><p>The Lord appeared unto Solomon by night, and spoke unto him. The Lord said, “If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land” (2 Chr. 7:13-14).</p><p>Let’s walk through this promise through prayer. While there are those who’d like to accuse New Testament Christians of taking this scripture out of context, the principles found in this text are timeless and true, no matter which testament they maybe found in.</p><p>“If my people.” Only two letters are used for this large word “if.” The condition of God’s promise was based on a conjunction. If Israel prayed, then God would answer. But if they refused to pray then the plagues and pestilence persisted. Prayer shouldn’t be a matter of ‘if’ but a matter of ‘when.’</p><p>“Called by my name.” Israel was God’s possession. They were His people, and they were called by His name. As an example a newborn child takes on the last name of its parents and the name proves possession. New Testament believers, who have been born again of water and Spirit (Jn. 3:1-21) through baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ and have received the Holy Spirit have become Christ’s possession (Acts 2:38; Rom. 8:9).</p><p>“Humble themselves.” The apostle Peter wrote, “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time” (1 Pt. 5:6). We are to humble ourselves, or risk being humbled of the Lord.</p><p>“Pray and seek my face.” Someone has said we are to seek God’s face, not just His hand. In other words, it’s important to love God more than His gifts. The writer of Hebrews said, “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him” (Heb. 11:6). If you will seek Him, you will find Him!</p><p>“Turn from their wicked ways.” Repentance is to turn from our wicked ways. This is more than just asking forgiveness, it’s turning away from sin and doing an about face to God. Jesus, John the Baptist and the Apostles all called for people to repent and put their trust in Christ (Matt. 3:8; Mk. 1:15; Acts 2:38).</p><p>“Then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”God is willing to hear our prayers, forgive our sins, and to heal our land. All of this depends, however, on people praying, humbling themselves, seeking God, and turning from their sins. What promises to obtain! Why wouldn’t we pray?</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 6-8	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-6-8.png

379	2020-09-25 11:32:56	\N	\N	\N	<p>Isaiah’s prophetic book is teeming with revelations about God. Perhaps one of the clearest revelations about God is the declaration that He alone is God and Savior. Chapters forty through forty-nine make statements that there is only one God, and He alone is the Savior of humanity. He is the first and the last (Isa. 41:3;44:6). He is the Holy One (Isa. 43:3). There is no other God besides Him (Isa. 43:10-11; 44:6). He alone created the heavens and the earth (Isa. 44:24;45:12,18). He alone is God and there is not another (Isa. 54:5-6). God alone is the Savior, and there is none else (Isa. 45:21-22; 49:26).</p><p>God is emphatically declaring that He alone is God. He alone is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. By Himself He will save humanity from their sin. All of this is to say, “I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory I will not give to another, neither my praise to graven images” (Isa. 42:8). No one else is God. No one else can claim to be Creator. No one else can claim to be Savior. Therefore, He will not share His glory with anything or anyone else.</p><p>Why is this important? Because we are quickly approaching Isaiah’s prophecy concerning God’s revealed plan to save humanity from their sin (Isa. 52-53). God wasn’t going to send someone else to do His work. Rather, “And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me” (Isa. 63:5).</p><p>In light of Isaiah’s book, when we reach the New Testament we gain a clearer picture. God is called Savior (1 Tim. 1:1; 2:3; 4:10; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4; Jude 1:25). Jesus is called Savior (2 Tim. 1:10; Titus 1:4; 2:13; 3:6; 2 Pt. 1:1; 2:20). God is called the Creator (Eph. 3:9; Rev. 4:11). Jesus is called the Creator (Col. 1:16; Heb.1:2). Finally, Jesus is declared to be Lord and God (Jn. 20:28).</p><p>These aren’t contradictory statements. Rather, Jesus Christ is God in flesh (Jn. 1:1-3; 14). Jesus isn’t another God, He is God! Jesus isn’t another Lord, He is Lord! Jesus isn’t a created lesser being than God, He is the Creator-God come in flesh! Jesus could do only what God could do, because He was God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 45-48	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-44-48.png
380	2020-09-25 11:31:22	\N	\N	\N	<p>In Isaiah chapter forty-two we are introduced to the Suffering Servant, which is predictive of Jesus Christ. “Behold my servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, Nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, And the smoking flax shall he not quench” (Isaiah 42:1–3).</p><p>The Suffering Servant would be gentle. This is unlike Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, who conquered and crushed everything considered weak (Isa. 41:2). Jesus, though all powerful, would not use His power to conquer and crush. Rather, He would not break a bruised reed, not quench a smoking flax.</p><p>A bruised reed refers to a handmade musical instrument. It was like a pipe or flute made from the thick stalk of a cane plant which grew on the water’s edge. If the hollow center of the already frail reed was bruised it would weaken and be unusable.</p><p>The smoking flax refers to a lamp wick made of flax that could no longer sustain a flame.This was considered useless for giving light. If the flax wick went out and smoldered it produced fumes that irritated the eyes. A smoldering wick would typically be extinguished so the burnt edge could be trimmed in order to make the lamp useful again.</p><p>The bruised reed and smoking flax are symbolic of how broken and weak people can be. Instead of discarding the broken and useless, the Suffering Servant would heal and mend.</p><p>Jesus Christ became the Suffering Servant that He might relate to humanity’s weakness. The writer of Hebrews wrote, “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin” (Heb. 4:15).</p><p>Jesus didn’t come to crush us, but to cure us.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 42-44	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-42-44.png
381	2020-09-20 14:36:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>What would you do if you knew you had fifteen years left to live? That’s the story of Hezekiah in Isaiah 38. King Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The Lord told Isaiah to go and tell Hezekiah to get his house in order, because his death was imminent. Hezekiah prayed earnestly for the Lord to reverse the sickness and death sentence. Before Isaiah could get home the Lord answered Hezekiah’s prayer.</p><p>The Lord told Hezekiah, &#8220;Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years” (Isaiah 38:4–5). Unfortunately, Hezekiah didn’t use those fifteen years wisely. Instead, he gave a tour of Jerusalem to Babylonian dignitaries (Isa. 39:1-4). Isaiah and the Lord weren’t too pleased with the king’s decision to give the Babylonians a sight-seeing of Jerusalem’s treasures (Isa. 38:5-8).</p><p>Hezekiah squandered his extra fifteen years. Bu what would you do if you knew you had those fifteen extra years left in your life? Would you try to reach more people with the gospel of Jesus Christ? Would you make amends with estranged loved one? Spend more time with your children? Write that book? Start that business? Give more? Serve more in your local church?</p><p>The problem is that we don’t know how much time we have left. Life is just a vapor, here today and gone tomorrow (Jas. 4:14). So while we may not be able to know how much time we have left, let us take full advantage of the time that we’ve been given to live it fully for Jesus.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 36-41	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-36-41.png
382	2020-09-17 00:09:12	\N	\N	\N	<p>What does ministry look like to you? Is it a preacher standing behind a pulpit preaching a fiery sermon? Is it someone singing on a platform? Whatever image comes to your mind when you think about ministry, it might be a little deficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, ‘Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense; He will come and save you’” (Isa. 35:3-4). This was the future ministry of Israel. They were to strengthen the weak, make firm the feeble, and encourage the fearful. What was the message that could accomplish such tasks? The Lord was coming again. He would condemn all of Israel’s enemies, and at the same time He would save Israel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In such a day as our’s, we should recognize the need for similar ministries. One doesn’t need to have supernatural powers to strengthen those with feeble hands, or to encourage those with weak knees. Jesus said, “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” (Matt. 25:35-40).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ministries of mercy are the kinds of ministries that the church should seek to administer in the communities in which they minister.

383	2020-09-14 17:20:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>The drunkards of Ephraim mocked the Lord’s message. It was as if they believed His commands to be too simple, and only for small children. They said, “Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little” (Isa. 28:9-10).</p><p>Though the men of Ephraim’s ridicule was wrong, their message was partially true. The truth of God’s Word is simple. God has given us His Word in plain language. The Word of God isn’t shrouded in codes and mysteries. The truth of God’s message isn’t just for the ivory tower intellectual. Rather, it is for everyone, no matter your education, ethnicity, or age. God has spoken, and it is His will for everyone to understand His message. On the other hand, those who give themselves to study the Word of God quickly realize the depth and profundity of God’s Word. Paradoxically it is both simple and profound!</p><p>God’s truth as plain as it is, however, can’t be learned overnight. It must be learned precept upon precept; line upon line; here a little, and there a little. There are no shortcuts to understanding truth. To accumulate a knowledge of God’s Word is to do it daily and consistently. Thankfully we can be assisted and equipped by the Spirit of Truth (Jn. 14:16-17).</p><p>Brother and sisters, let us at once take up the Word of God. Read it, study it, and apply it. Then do it again daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. And after time you will begin to comprehend all that you have learned.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 28-30	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-28-30.png
384	2020-09-13 11:19:17	\N	\N	\N	<p>God’s judgment of the whole earth is coming sooner rather than later. Isaiah used the phrase “in that day” four times in reference to God’s imminent condemnation of a sinful world (Isa. 26:1; 27:1-2,12). Likewise, in that day there will also be salvation and peace: “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation” (Isa. 25:9). Those who have been in covenant with the Lord, and who have kept His commands will be saved.</p><p>“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength” (Isa. 26:3-4). The one whose mind is “stayed” on God will have perfect peace. The word “stayed” in the Hebrew means “to be made secure or firm.” The “stayed” mind is supported and sustained. This is not mere focus or concentration. Rather, this is a mind that is supported through the peace and strength of the Lord. Surely, this would have to be the case for those who live in such restless times. A mind distracted during conflict must be sustained through God’s peace and assurance.</p><p>As the world plunges itself deeper into the bottled-up wrath of God, it is important that we keep our minds stayed on the Lord.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 23-27	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-23-27.png
385	2020-09-13 00:20:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>In the twenty second chapter of Isaiah we find an interesting encounter between the prophet Isaiah and a man named Shebna. Shebna was a palace governor of King Hezekiah, involved in the negotiations with Sennacherib when he besieged Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:18, 26, 37; 19:2; Isa. 36:3, 11, 22; 37:2). Some Bible commentators believe that Shebna’s role was likened to a prime minister.Shebna carried great responsibility for the well-being of Israel, both spiritually and politically.</p><p>Isaiah met Shebna on the side of a mountain. God begins by asking, in essence, “What are you doing here? And who do you think you are?” Shebna was acting in arrogance. He was acting like he was a somebody. God was not impressed with his presumption and audacity. He was in a place he wasn’t supposed to be. He was doing something he shouldn’t be doing.</p><p>Apparently Shebna had decided to put much of his energy in building himself an ornate tomb. This tomb would be a monument to his life. It’s one thing to prepare for the future, like purchasing a tombstone or gravesite, but it’s another when you put all of your effort into something that has very little meaning.</p><p>Shebna could have been using his power to serve the people of Israel, but instead wanted to dress up his own monument. His legacy and reputation was his great concern. He cares very little for the people’s glory, or for God’s glory, but cares deeply about his own glory.</p><p>Isaiah tells Shebna that far from being important and significant, he is a “disgrace to his master’s house” (Isa. 22:18). Instead of being memorialized before all the people, he will be wadded up and thrown away like a piece of paper. No more beautiful chariots. No more worldly prominence. Shebna was going to be pulled down from his self-imposed lofty status.</p><p>Shebna wasted his life on something so insignificant when he could have been doing something that gave meaning to so many. There on the side of the mountain was an empty to tomb, a memorial for a wasted life.</p><p>Not far from Jerusalem is another tomb. This tomb belonged to a man named Joseph of Arimathea. Rather than be buried there, he gave that tomb to the body of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ didn’t come to be served, but to serve, to give His life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:28).</p><p>Beloved, Jesus Christ is the example that we should follow. He made Himself of no reputation. Jesus didn’t come and try to make a monument for Himself. Rather, He became a servant to all. Let us live for God&#8217;s glory, and not for our own</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 18-22	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-18-22.png
386	2020-09-11 16:09:55	\N	\N	\N	<p>Imagine there’s no such thing as a devil. Then imagine you’re dwelling in a heavenly place in the presence of God. Now imagine getting kicked out of heaven. This is what Isaiah saw in this event describing the fall of the king of Babylon.</p><p>Jesus used Isaiah’s message concerning the king of Babylon to depict Satan’s fall from heaven (Lk. 10:18). The prophet Ezekiel used a similar account to describe Satan’s expulsion from glory (Ezk. 28:12-19).</p><p>The issue remains, how does one get banished from heaven? Satan didn’t begin as a devil. Contrary, he was an angel at first. Isaiah gives us some insight. “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation…I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High” (Isa. 14:12-14). Notice the five “I wills.” Lucifer planned to exalt himself above God. This wasn’t just sheer ambition. This was pride, and thus we have our answer to how one can be exiled from heaven: pride.</p><p>“Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall” (Pro. 16:18). Satan’s pride got him booted from heave, which set of a fire storm of rebellion and evil.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re an angel or a saint, God will not put up with pride. Just when you think pride will lift you, God will bring you low. But if you will remain humble, you will find grace: “But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble” (Jas. 4:6).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 13-17	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-13-17.png
387	2020-09-09 21:17:17	\N	\N	\N	<p>Part of Isaiah’s prophetic message to Judah included the hope of light in a time of darkness (Isa. 9:1-2). Another portion of the hopeful prophecy was the anticipation of a child who would be God manifest in the flesh: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace” (Isa. 9:6).</p><p>Isaiah’s book includes many wonderful prophecies of the Son of God. But this prophecy was one of the clearest statements that God alone would come and provide deliverance and salvation, and He was going to accomplish it through the seed of David (Isa. 9:7). God the Father was going to robe Himself in flesh and born of a virgin (Isa. 7:14). Matthew wrote when Mary gave birth to Jesus, “Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, ‘Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us’” (Matt. 1:22-23).</p><p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was both God and man at the same time. He wasn’t half-god, and half-man. He wasn’t all God and no man. He wasn’t all man and no God. He was the God-Man. It is in Jesus Christ, and not anywhere else, that one can find God. Jesus implied this when He said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (Jn. 14:6). If you are going to find salvation and know God, then you must believe that Jesus Christ is the full revelation of God (Jn. 8:24). All the attributes, titles, and roles of God dwell in Jesus. He is the incarnation of the one true God (Jn. 1:1, 14; 8:58; 10:30; 14:9-11, 16-18, 20:28; 2 Cor. 3:17). Jesus is God in flesh. He isn’t the eternal Son, rather He is the Everlasting Father. He is the Mighty God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9)!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 9-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-9-12.png

389	2020-09-05 20:43:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Isaiah is a mountain of a book. It is sixty-six chapters spanning the ministry of the prophet Isaiah during the reign of four Judean kings (Isa. 1:1). Isaiah prophesied during the Northern Kingdom’s fall and desolation and the steady decline of the Southern Kingdom. What happened in Israel was destined to happen in Judah if they failed to keep in covenant with Jehovah. They had rebelled; spurned God’s commands; and rejected His correction (1:2-8). Their failure was going to bring about God’s judgment.</p><p>Jehovah was willing to give them another chance. He urged them to repent and return to Him, promising to cleanse and restore His people: “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool” (Isa. 1:18). God wanted Judah to come and “reason” with Him. This is illustrative of a court hearing. Judah was guilty of breaking the covenant and their sins were the color of scarlet. In other words, there was blood on their hands proving their guilt.</p><p>Though their sins were as scarlet, they would become “white as snow.” This indicates the profound nature of God’s grace and mercy. He can cleanse that which stains and make it look as if it had never happened.</p><p>Such cleansing would be accomplished through Isaiah’s prophesied Messiah. He would be the King from David’s dynasty to reign for all eternity (Isa. 6-37). He would be the Suffering Servant taking the place of sinners (Isa. 38-55). And He would vanquish all foes as the Conqueror (Isa. 56-66).</p><p>Beloved, our hope for the cleansing of our sin is found in Jesus Christ. He shed His blood to remove the stain of sin in our lives.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Isaiah 1-4	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Isaiah-1-4.png
390	2020-09-02 14:25:28	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Song of Solomon is a beautiful and passionate poem conveying romantic love between a young shepherd (1:7), and a young Shulammite girl (1:8).</p><p>While the book of Revelation has its many interpretations, due to its complexity and use of metaphors, Song of Solomon may not be too far behind. There are many schools of thought concerning how to interpret this poetic book. Some scholars try to read the book through a strict literal interpretation. Others try to read it through a loose allegorical interpretation. But, isn’t that the beauty of poetry in the first place? Poets take literal events and employ metaphors and word pictures to describe it. There is little doubt that this book is about romantic love. Have you ever tried to describe love? Have you ever attempted to conjure up the right words to communicate your passion for your spouse?</p><p>Solomon, Israel’s third king, was a man of such passion. Scripture reveals that he wrote over three thousand proverbs, and penned over a thousand songs (1 Kings 4:32). He spoke about trees, beasts, birds, reptiles, and fish (1 Kings 4:33). Furthermore, Solomon had 700 wives, and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:1-3)! Unfortunately, those women turned his heart away from the Lord. A man of many words and wives surely had to come up with plenty of love songs and poems!</p><p>The Song of Solomon has made many believers blush throughout history. Romance and sexual desire has become a taboo within the Church. For it to be included in Holy Scripture should give us some indication that God has given such emotional and physical love as gifts to His creation. Song of Solomon presents sexual desire as it should be &#8211; within the confines of a committed marriage between a man and woman.</p><p>Though we might be able to use the Song of Solomon as a metaphor between Christ and the Church, perhaps we could use the book as a guide to enhance our love within our own marriages. Proving that God doesn’t just care about the supernatural salvation of our souls, He also cares about the natural details of our lives.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Song of Solomon 1-8	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Song-of-Solomon-1-8.png
391	2020-08-31 18:00:06	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Preacher sought meaning in wisdom and came up empty handed (Ecc. 1:12-18). He looked for significance in pleasure and found it severely lacking (Ecc. 2:1-11). Next, he looked for importance in work and realized there wasn’t anything to be gained from all of his hard work (Ecc. 2:17-26). Whether it was wisdom, work, wealth, or pleasure, it was all considered to be meaningless.</p><p>Therefore, brothers and sisters, what is the end of it all? It is to fear God and keep his commandments (Ecc.12:13-14). Whatever God does endures forever, nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken away from it (Ecc. 3:14). God has placed eternity within the heart of man (Ecc. 3:10). The issue is that man attempts to fill it with pleasure, wisdom, toil, relationships, the pursuit of wealth, and education and yet it leaves him empty. It is vanity of vanities! Meaningless! A striving after wind.</p><p>Thankfully we aren’t left to our own devices. A greater than Solomon appears in the New Testament (Matt. 12:42). Jesus, the Son of David, Who is the image of the invisible God, the Creator of heaven and earth. He is the ultimate Son of David. He speaks in parables, proverbs, and even with a little cynicism: “What does it profit a man if he gains the world and loses His soul?” It was this preacher, who looked at a woman who simply came to draw water for her thirst who had been with five men, whom she called husbands, Jesus tells her, with an echo of Ecclesiastes: “If you drink of this water you will thirst again. But if you drink from the living water you will never thirst.” When you drink from the world’s pleasure, you will still be in thirst. The temporal striving under the sun that she lost a lifetime to, could be replaced with an eternal thirst quencher. The vapor of ruined relationships would be replenished with Living Water. Jesus wasn’t offering a vapor, He was offering the substance.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, Jesus wants you to stop chasing vapors, and instead drink from the Substance. The end of the matter is fear God and obey his commandments. The meaningless fades with the wind and is replaced with divine purpose.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ecclesiastes 9-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ecclesiastes-9-12.png
392	2020-08-30 11:01:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Preacher (Solomon) began his search for purpose in wisdom (Ecc. 1:12-18). He thought, perhaps, that he would find meaning in knowledge and understanding.</p><p>At the beginning of Solomon’s reign, he petitioned the Lord for understanding in leading Israel (1 Kings 3:7-9). The Lord granted his request and gave him much more than he desired (1 Kings 3:10-14). After this, Solomon was considered the wisest man to live (1 Kings 3:28). God had given him wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the past and all the wisdom of Egypt (1 Kings 4:29-31). Additionally, Solomon was an accomplished writer penning 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs (1 Kings 4:32).</p><p>This is what Solomon confirmed in his search for meaning in wisdom:<br />“I said in my heart, ‘I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.’ And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind. For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow” (Ecclesiastes 1:16–18)<br />Solomon’s great wisdom did not unlock happiness or meaning. Solomon studied the world and only found emptiness. The poor were oppressed and had no one to comfort them (Ecc. 4:1). Though God created man to be upright, there wasn’t a righteous man found on earth who did good and never sinned (Ecc. 7:20, 29). He found people cursing each other (Ecc. 7:21-22). Evil men doing evil works and getting away with it (Ecc. 8:10-13). Further, evil and folly are found on king’s thrones (Ecc. 10:5-6).</p><p>The increase of wisdom and knowledge only brought about grief and sorrow. Wisdom did not give him rose-colored glasses, alternatively, it unveiled the emptiness of all that was under the sun. Which led Solomon to conclude the transience of life.</p><p>Wisdom would not prolong Solomon’s life. Both the wise and the foolish would meet the same end. It is not that wisdom is useless. Rather, wisdom and understanding do not bring meaning to life. This is wisdom!</p><p>Beloved, the greatest wisdom you can attain is knowing Jesus Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. 2:3).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ecclesiastes 5-8	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ecclesiastes-5-8.png
393	2020-08-29 11:36:12	\N	\N	\N	<p>Ecclesiastes was penned at the hand of Israel’s King Solomon, the son of David (1:1). In the Hebrew, he calls himself “Qoheleth” which means “preacher” or “teacher.” The name Ecclesiastes comes from the Greek (not the Hebrew) and is a form of “ekklesia” which is the Greek word for “church” in the NT. Therefore, on a more specific note, Ecclesiastes refers to an assembly and Solomon is the Preacher addressing the congregation.</p><p>“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,” says the Preacher. This phrase is used thirty-six times in Ecclesiastes. The word for “vanity” in Hebrew does not mean “excessive pride.” Instead, this word “hebel” means “wind,” “vapor,” “puff of smoke” or “breath.” Taken literally, the Hebrew word refers to a puff of smoke rising from a chimney in the winter or the steam that rises from a hot cup of coffee. According to the Preacher, life is like that. It is nothing more than a vapor, or a mist. You see it for a moment, then it is gone. Even the Bible compares our lives to a mere breath (Ps. 39:5), and to a mist that appears for a short time then vanishes (Jam. 4:14).</p><p>The Preacher connects the transience of life with life’s meaningless pursuits and declares that they are vanity! The NIV translates “hebel” as meaningless. The Preacher wants to let his assembly know that a life inundated with trivial pursuits will end up meaningless. “All is vanity” according to the Preacher. Life is full of frustrated futility. In other words, nothing in this life will make us happy. It is vanity and a “vexation of spirit” (1:14). This phrase in the Hebrew refers to a chasing after wind. Chasing after vapors is meaningless. Not being able to acquire a vapor causes a vexation of spirit.</p><p>According to the Preacher, everything under the sun is meaningless. “Under the sun” expresses the extent of our problem. Where do we experience life’s futility and frustration? Everywhere the sun shines. Yet this phrase also opens up the possibility of a different perspective. To see things &#8220;under the sun” is to look at them from the ground level, taking an earthly point of view and leaving God out of the picture.</p><p>Ecclesiastes shows us the weariness of life and the frustrations of living under the sun. It reveals that what is under the sun cannot give meaning, satisfaction or purpose. Certainly if we leave God out of our lives, then everything is vanity. Keeping God at the center of our lives, however, gives purpose to everything that we do.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ecclesiastes 1-4	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ecclesiastes-1-4.png

394	2020-08-29 02:31:00	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Proverbs was written primarily for young men. A “son” is referred to no less than forty times in the book. Compare that to “daughter” not being mentioned at all. Of course everyone can learn and apply the wisdom from Proverbs. So when we get to the last chapter, it shouldn’t be any surprise that this portion was a lesson from a mother to a son (Prov. 31:1).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Whoever King Lemuel was, he had a wise mother. I can attest to the blessing of having a wise mother. We can read of some of the amazing advice Lemuel’s mother gave him. The standout advice is concerning finding a wife. “Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies” (Prov. 31:10). It’s not that its impossible to find a virtuous woman, it’s just that its rare. A virtuous woman’s value is worth far more than the most precious diamond. For a man to find a virtuous woman is both rare and priceless. If you ever attain something that is both rare and invaluable, you won’t want to lose it. You’ll want to do everything within your power to keep and protect it. Brothers, that also means that you don’t need to fall in love with the first girl that you meet. Search and pray. Sisters, the same is just as true for you. Just because that man-child has a large bank account, doesn’t mean he’s the one. Seek and pray.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Let me also make some additional remarks to my fellow brothers. A rare and valuable woman isn’t going to fall in love with an average Joe. Don’t be on the hunt for a Proverbs 31 woman if you aren’t willing to be a Proverbs 1-31 man. Read this book that was written for young men, and become a man that a rare and invaluable woman is looking for. You don’t need to settle for less, and she doesn’t either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 30-31	\N	/BC858CDA-201B-4E49-ACE1-C3B834278C8D.png
395	2020-08-28 00:16:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>Never in my life have I been through a year like 2020. Nothing has been the same since the month of March when the shutdown began due to the pandemic. I’m sure the majority of us can relate that entire calendars have been upended. Nearly all of the events that we had scheduled have been cancelled. We hardly ever worried about something being cancelled before the pandemic, unless it was due to inclement weather.</p><p>“Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth” (Prov. 27:1). How true is that proverb for 2020? Previously we could schedule plans and simply count down until the day arrived. Not in 2020! We now live day to day. An outbreak of the infection could overtake a city, or state. Churches can shut down if someone comes down with a fever. Governments can decide to shut down businesses if they feel it will slow a possible spread of the virus. Anything and everything changes in just a short moment. We cannot boast of tomorrow, because we don’t know what a day may bring forth.</p><p>The apostle James wrote, “Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that” (Jas. 4:13-15). I find myself saying, “If the Lord wills” more now than I ever have. Because, honestly, I can’t boast in tomorrow let alone next week or next month.</p><p>Beloved, we may not know what tomorrow holds, but we do know Who holds tomorrow!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 27-29	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-27-29.png
396	2020-08-27 23:56:04	\N	\N	\N	<p>My mother taught me several valuable lessons about relationships. One of those lessons was about not inviting yourself to someone’s house. Mother wouldn’t let me go anywhere if she thought I had invited myself rather than being invited. Her reasoning was that people treat invited guests different than they treat those who have invited themselves.</p><p>Another lesson she taught me was about over staying your welcome. Just because you were invited doesn’t mean you’re invited to stay forever. People and families need time to be alone, or to have time just with their family.</p><p>I heard my mother’s voice as I read: “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, lest he have his fill of you and hate you” (Prov. 25:17 ESV). A person’s home is their sanctuary. If they constantly have guests, invited or uninvited, they won’t have the space needed to relax.</p><p>As a single young man I traveled the country as a full-time evangelist. Often I’d stay in a pastor’s home in a spare bedroom. I always tried to be cognizant of my welcome. I’d be sure to be as unnoticed as humanly possible. I’d come in at a decent hour, and keep the room tidy. But I’d wake up before the pastor and his family to leave and find a coffee shop or go to the church to study and prepare for the day. I didn’t want to be a nuisance while I was staying in a pastor’s home.</p><p>The book of Proverbs provides many life lessons that may not seem spiritual on the surface, but can be very beneficial for day to day living. It’d be wise to go through the book of Proverbs and read slowly marking valuable life lessons to be applied to your life.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 24-26	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-24-26.png
397	2020-08-25 11:25:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>According to the overall consensus of Proverbs you don’t have to be old in order to be wise. As I have written previously, many of the proverbs were written from the vantage point of a father who sought to instruct his young son (Pro. 1:8-19; 3:1-12; 4:1-27). The young man was to take his father’s advice that he might mature into manhood. The older man intended to teach and train the young man in the way that he should go with the hopes that when he grew older he would remember what he was taught as a young man (Pro. 22:6).</p><p>Wisdom, maturity, and understanding are not something you receive simply because you graduate college, have a family and a retirement plan. History records the lives of many old fools, just as it records the history of many wise young men. The wise young man knows when it is time to set aside childish things in order to become a man (1 Cor. 13:11).</p><p>Proverbs outlines many attributes of the wise man. It would be wise to apply these characteristics to our lives.</p><p>The wise man fears the Lord (Pro. 1:7). Having a fear of the Lord doesn’t mean that you are afraid of Him. Rather, it means you live in awe of His holiness, justice, power, and authority. The wise man loves his wife (Pro. 18:22). Loving your spouse seems obvious to most. But the wise person seeks to honor and serve their spouse in word and deed. The wise man takes responsibility (Pro. 27:8). Fools make excuses, but wise men and women take ownership. The wise man is a good father (Pro. 22:6). Too often parents want to be their children’s best friend, instead of being their parent. The wise man has integrity (Pro. 20:7). The word “integrity” in the Hebrew means “purity,” “completeness,” “blamelessness.” Having integrity is to go against the grain of modern society. The wise man flees temptation (Pro. 1:8-19; 7:6-9). It doesn’t matter if you are enmeshed in the work-a-day world or if you’re a hermit staying away from the world, temptation will find you. The wise man knows how to refuse the world’s temptations.</p><p>We could go on and on looking at the characteristics of the wise man. You might be overwhelmed with the prospect of being a wise man. The attributes listed may seem impossible to attain. There is hope, however. The apostle James wrote, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (Jam. 1:5). Beloved, wisdom is only a prayer away.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 22-23	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-22-23.png
681	2017-10-27 10:16:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>The man who will not work is not wise. Laziness is a plague that ruins lives, and societies. The book of Proverbs uses the word “sluggard” for the man who will not work or give any effort. The antithesis of the diligent man is the sluggard. The Hebrew word for “sluggard” is defined as a “lazy person, a person who is disinclined to work or exert himself.” In other words they are sluggish, slothful, and undisciplined. Another translation literally says they are “lazy bones.” It gives the idea of someone who does not have the willpower to work. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish to eat something and will not even bring it back to his mouth (Pro. 19:24). The sluggard is too lazy to lift food to his mouth! What a tragedy! When you shirk from your responsibilities and will not lift a hand to help yourself then you are considered a sluggard.</p><p>The most vulnerable to succumb to laziness are youth. Culture is consistently peddling the erroneous idea that wealth can be achieved without working. Gambling and the lottery have kept more enslaved to poverty than they have made millionaires. But Scripture is clear that if you are going to be blessed, and successful, then you are going to have to work. Laziness will not be blessed. Being a sluggard will not be rewarded.</p><h2>Five Characteristics of the Sluggard</h2><ol><li><strong>The Sluggard Loves Sleep</strong>: “<em>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man</em>” (Proverbs 6:10–11). I remember wanting to sleep in when I was a teenager, especially when I was in grade school. I can still hear my father coming up the stairs to wake me up for school. The sluggard would rather sleep than work. He would rather stay in bed than take care of his responsibilities. Why take initiative when you could stay in bed? Granted, everyone needs to rest, we were created with bodies that require sleep. This does not mean that we should sleep more than we work. You have more energy when you are young, don’t waste those years. Redeem the time while you are young (Eph. 5:16)!<br />Proverbs 20:13 says, “Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.” Sleep will rob you of time, opportunities, and wealth. Sleep is a like a armed man ready to rob you of opportunities, dreams and ambitions. Many are in poverty because they love sleep more than work. Work while it is day (Jn. 9:4). Wake up and get your work done. Don’t hit the snooze button on life and miss opportunities.</li><li><strong>The Sluggard Makes Excuses:</strong> “<em>The sluggard says, ‘There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets</em>” (Pro. 22:13)! The sluggard is always making excuses why he can’t go to work. He will imagine all of the dangers that could happen if he were to leave the confines of his bed and go to work. The sluggard in Provers 22:13 believed there was a lion in the street. He was mistaken, the real danger was in the excuses he made. The dog ate your homework excuse will not work in the real world. There are too many people who have the initiative and qualifications who are willing to work, and an employer will not be loyal to an excuse giver. If your currency is to always make excuses, one day you are going to run out of them and all you will have left is regret.</li><li><strong>The Sluggard Procrastinates:</strong> “<em>The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing</em>” (Pro. 20:4). Instead of plowing at the appointed time, the sluggard procrastinated and ended up having nothing at harvest. If you are always saying “I’ll do it later,” or “I’ll get to it tomorrow,” chances are that you will never get the task completed. Always putting a chore or task off only prolongs the responsibility. If you will do the job immediately, complete the homework when before it is due, prepare while you have time, then you will always be successful. The more you delay the less likely you are to do the work. Parents, teachers, and employers will not give you more responsibilities if you are unable to complete the tasks you have already been given.</li><li><strong>The Sluggard is Self-Deceived:</strong> “<em>Lazy people consider themselves smarter than seven wise counselors</em>” (Pro. 26:16 NLT). If you want to give people a bad impression of yourself then consider yourself smarter than everyone you meet. The sluggard has it all figured out, so he thinks. He has deceived himself! The one thing a know-it-all doesn’t know is that he doesn’t know it all. Laziness intoxicates and deceives. Pride is the fool’s drug, and arrogance is the sluggard’s elixir. Together they inebriate the fool to think that he is smarter than he is</li><li><strong>The Sluggard is a Destructive Force</strong>: “<em>I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense, and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down</em>” (Proverbs 24:30–31). When a man loves sleep, makes excuses, procrastinates, and is self-deceived then his life will come to ruin. Being a lazy bones is not profitable. The consequences of being a sluggard are plenteous. He will lose his job, be unemployed and broke (Pro. 6:11; 10:4; 15:19; 19:15; 20:13). The sluggard will have nothing but regrets of failures, missed opportunities, and unfulfilled ambitions (Pro. 21:25-26). The lazy man will experience unsatisfied desires and having to do without the pleasures of life (Pro. 13:4). Finally, the sluggard will be a disgrace to his parents, his family, his friends and to himself (Pro. 10:5). All that he will have left are the weeds of anguish, and the thorns of bitterness.</li></ol><p>Young men, you should do everything in your power to avoid being a sluggard. There is nothing rewarding or satisfying about being lazy. You do not honor, nor bring glory to God with laziness. You were created with a purpose. Do not buy into the lie that laziness is acceptable, or that you are entitled to certain benefits. The wise man is a man who avoids the path of the sluggard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This post is part of an ongoing series entitled</em>: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/25/wisdom-for-young-men/"><strong>Wisdom for Young Men</strong></a></p>	100	\N	The Sluggard	\N	/morgan-lane-n7u0-cpFcW8-unsplash.jpg
682	2017-10-26 17:54:06	\N	\N	\N	<p>The wise man is a working man. Young men need to be taught the value of hard work while they are young, so they can be successful when they are older. At a young age I was taught the value of a work ethic. By the time I was fourteen or fifteen I was working construction full-time during the summer. Throughout high school I worked various jobs after a long day spent in classes. If I was going to have money then I was going to need a job. I also had the responsibility of keeping my grades up, if I was going to continue working. My parents instilled into me the value of work. As we will see work is good and meaningful, and is rooted in Scripture.</p><h2>A Theology of Work</h2><p>Scripture opens with God doing work. God created and worked to bring about all of creation. Each phase of God’s work was considered “good” (Gen. 1:4,10,12,18,21,25,31). Theologian James Hamilton writes, “In addition to being able to marshal his army of words to accomplish his purposes, then, we see from this vast and splendid universe that God is a skilled worker who completes his tasks with unparalleled excellence and creativity.”</p><p>When God created Adam He gave him the responsibility to keep and work the garden (Gen. 2:15). Adam was to have dominion over the garden, not to be a passive observer of God’s creation. God did not put Adam in the garden to simply enjoy the fruit of God’s labor, but he was to work and enjoy his own labor as well. As image bearers and imitators of God, we were created to work. Paradise was not going to be without work. Some imagine that paradise is life without work, swinging in a hammock on a beach living off the fruit of the land. However, work is a God given responsibility that brings Him glory, and gives us satisfaction.</p><p>When Adam sinned work became a drudgery and not a delight. Adam, and his offspring, were going to sweat and labor to produce results (Gen. 3:17-19). This is the reason why many do not enjoy work, they only see the thorns and thistles. Just as man needed to be redeemed, so did work. The work of Jesus Christ at Calvary redeemed humanity and redeemed the way they live, which includes work. Christians are to no longer live the old life, but to live as a redeemed people. The Apostle Paul writes that the thief is to no longer steal, but to do honest work (Eph. 4:28).</p><p>Scripture conveys the idea that the man who works is blessed:</p><p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 128<br />1 Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in his ways!<br />2 You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.<br />3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.<br />4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the Lord.<br />5 The Lord bless you from Zion! May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life!<br />6 May you see your children’s children! Peace be upon Israel!</p><p>The diligent worker will eat from the fruit of his labor (Ps. 128:2). Blessings flow from the Lord to the man who works. If this is not taught at a young age, then boys who grow older never see the blessing of hard work. Instead, there will be a generation that feels they are entitled to have wealth. Who are we kidding? This is the status of the present generation. Entitlement is the paralysis of hard work. Laziness is the currency of the entitled. In contrast past generations built their wealth and enjoyed success due to their diligence in work. If young men are not taught the value of work, or if they are not taught that work gives God glory, then blessings will be far and few between for men in the future.</p><h2>Proverbs and Work</h2><p>The book of Proverbs has much to say about work:</p><ul><li><em>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense</em> (Proverbs 12:11).</li><li><em>From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good, and the work of a man’s hand comes back to him</em> (Proverbs 12:14).</li><li><em>The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor</em> (Proverbs 12:24).</li><li><em>Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth</em> (Proverbs 12:27).</li><li><em>In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty</em> (Proverbs 14:23).</li></ul><p>These are only a handful of the proverbs concerning work. This does not include those proverbs that deal with laziness which we will cover in the next lesson.</p><p>Young men who might not yet be in the work force can still learn the value of work. Whether it is in academics, athletics, music, trade skills, or relationships. The blessings are endless for studying hard, practicing often, and putting in time and effort in any discipline. But this must be learned at a young age. The habits that are cultivated now will be hard to break later in life. This holds true for good and bad habits. If you are consistently late when you are young, then you will be consistently late when you are older. The young man who never does his homework and never prepares for tests will have a difficult time doing the tasks assigned to him while working for an employer. The young man who would rather sleep than take care of his responsibilities will be a slave to sleep when he is older.</p><p>There have been many young men who have not allowed their age to become their excuse for not working. Take Timothy for example. He was probably in his late teens or early twenties when he began traveling with the Apostle Paul. Paul considered Timothy to be his son in the faith (1 Tim. 1:2). Timothy was admired by fellow believers (Acts 16:1-2). He was also part of the growth of the church in Macedonia and Achaia (Acts 17:14-15; 18:5). As a young man Timothy was left to oversee the largest body of Christian believers which was located in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3). Timothy was not allowed to use youth as a crutch. Instead he was to use his youth to his advantage. If Timothy would take care of his responsibilities, then the elders of Ephesus wouldn’t despise him for his age (1 Tim. 4:12). Timothy was to give his life for the work of the Lord. Age is not a qualification for calling or work. The more you discipline your life in your youth, the better off you will be in your later years.</p><h2>Four Steps for a Better Work Ethic</h2><ol><li><strong>Don’t Procrastinate:</strong> “<em>A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich</em>” (Pro. 10:4). Don’t procrastinate when you have the time to get something done. If your parents ask you to do chores, do them before you do anything else. When you have homework to do, do it if you have time in class, or as soon as you get home. Putting things off only adds to your other responsibilities. Getting your responsibilities done in timely fashion pays dividends.</li><li><strong>Get Organized:</strong> “<em>Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty</em>” (Proverbs 21:5 NLT). Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” If you are always forgetting things (like most young and old men!) then you need to get organized. You always have your smartphone with you, so make it work for you. Set reminders, use your calendar, write things in the notes app. Or get some Field Notes and always have a pen with you so you can write stuff down. Make lists and mark off the things that you accomplish. This will help you see progress. There are no shortcuts to success. Doing things at the last minute, or only doing the minimum required will not yield excellence.</li><li><strong>Forsake Worthless Pursuits:</strong> “<em>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense</em>” (Pro. 12:11). This verse could say, “but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks CENTS!” Giving your time and energy to worthless things will not pay. What does it profit a young man if he spends his entire day playing video games, but loses his soul? You’re not going to make money by going undefeated on NBA 2K18, or killing a bunch zombies. How much time do you waste on social media? You could be practicing your athletic, musical, or trade skills. You could be studying for that upcoming final, or writing that paper. Do the hard stuff now and unwind at the end of the day knowing you’ve accomplished your goals.</li><li><strong>Set Personal Goals:</strong> “<em>Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity..</em>” (Pro. 21:5). Going back to this verse we see that good planning leads to prosperity. What are the goals for your life? Where do you want to be in five, ten, twenty years? What type of career do you want to pursue? You will never reach the goals that you never set. If you have a vision for your future then you will need to start working and planning now. You cannot be passive about your future, or you will be a slave to the winds of time.</li></ol><p>Becoming a young man of wisdom requires a work ethic. Get some feedback from peers, parents and teachers on how you can improve your work ethic. Talk with your local church leaders about how you can get involved in work around the church. Find out where you can serve and volunteer in your church and community. Take the initiative to become a diligent man, and by the grace of God you be the man that God created you to be.</p><p><em>This is post is part of an ongoing series entitled</em> &#8220;<strong><a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/25/wisdom-for-young-men/">Wisdom For Young Men</a></strong>.&#8221;</p>	100	\N	The Diligent Man	\N	
683	2017-10-25 19:15:20	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Proverbs is not just a divine book filled with quips and maxims for life. The book of Proverbs was written and compiled with the objective that the reader can know wisdom and instruction; to understand words of insight, to gain instruction in righteousness, justice and equity. The proverbs are also are written to give prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the youth (Pro. 1:2-4).</p><p>Many of the proverbs are written from the vantage point of a father who seeks to instruct his young son (Pro. 1:8-19; 3:1-12; 4:1-27). The young son is to take his father’s advice that he might mature into manhood. Such a son is his father’s delight (Pro. 15:20). A father intends to teach and train his son in the way that he should go in hopes that the son, when grown, will never depart from those teachings (Pro. 22:6).</p><p>The Hebrew word for “proverb” means “to rule.” The reader is to be ruled by the divine instructions that are written. These are words to live by. Like all of divine Scripture, the proverbs are profitable for the reader (2 Tim. 3:16). Reading, hearing, and obeying the teaching found within Proverbs will make one wise. On the other hand if the reader rejects the wisdom found in the book, then they are considered fools. The book of Proverbs contrasts those who are wise with those who are foolish. The father intends to raise a wise man, and not a fool.</p><p>Wisdom is not just for senior citizens who have lived a full life. It is clear that the proverbs teach that even the youth can be wise. It is godly and spiritual to desire to be wise. James wrote that if we lack wisdom we can petition God to grant us wisdom (Jam. 1:5). God is capable of giving wisdom because He is wise (Rom 16:27; Jude 25) Godly wisdom is pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy, fruitful, and it is without partiality and hypocrisy (Jam. 3:17). Such wisdom is to be desired by the aged as well as by the young. When James says we are to “ask of God” when we lack wisdom, the Greek word for “ask” means to “beg, call for, or crave.” Christians of all ages and status should crave godly wisdom. The tides of culture bring new challenges, and the Christian needs godly wisdom to help him navigate through those challenges. As the culture trades truth for tolerance, the Christian needs a wisdom that can only come from God. The type of wisdom that young people need will not be found in the halls of the universities, but it will be found upon their knees in prayer with open Bibles.</p><h2>Lessons for Young Men</h2><p>Proverbs yields instructions for young men. I have selected several lessons from the book of Proverbs that I believe are beneficial for young men. The number of boys who grow up without a father-figure is increasing each generation. The result is lack of wisdom in real life situations. Without the proper teaching young men are left to make choices on their own. There is a great need for equipping and training young men to become successful men. These lessons (though not exhaustive, and certainly not all that can be learned from Proverbs) can be beneficial in instructing the young men of this generation.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/26/the-diligent-man/">The Diligent Man</a>:</strong> “<em>Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense</em>” (Pro. 12:11). The book of Proverbs sets forth many lessons concerning the God-glorifying discipline of hard work.</li><li><a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/27/the-sluggard/"><strong>The Sluggard</strong></a>: “The sluggard says, “<em>There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets</em>” (Pro. 22:13). The sluggard is the opposite of the diligent man. Too many young men lack a work ethic, which leads to many trials and tribulations.</li><li><strong>The Wise Man</strong>: “<em>Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding</em>” (Pro. 3:13). Wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord, and it yields great increase in life.</li><li><a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/11/04/the-fool/"><strong>The Fool</strong></a>: “<em>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice</em>” (Pro. 12:15). The wise father warns his young son of the folly of being a fool.</li><li><strong>The Strange Woman</strong>: “<em>For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword</em>” (Proverbs 5:3–4). Warnings abound in the Proverbs concerning the strange woman who seeks to destroy every man.</li><li><a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/11/15/the-friend/"><strong>The Friend</strong></a>: “<em>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity</em>” (Pro. 17:17). Young men need to be taught the value of friendships. Scripture is replete with stories about friendships, both good and bad.</li><li><strong>The Wealthy Man</strong>: “<em>Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth</em>” (Pro. 12:27). Money management is just as spiritual as prayer. Young men need to learn the value of money and how to take care of it.</li><li><strong>The Righteous Man</strong>: “<em>Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor</em>” (Pro. 21:21). Righteous living is possible for the young man. The wise man must be a righteous man.</li></ul>	100	\N	Wisdom For Young Men	\N	/ben-white-1MHU3zpTvro-unsplash.jpg
684	2017-10-22 01:40:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br />O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? (1 Corinthians 15:54–55)</p><h1>The Merchants of Death</h1><p>Christianity is a message about life. On the other hand, Christianity is also a message about death. Now, it should be noted that Christianity is not about harming or killing people who do not convert. Undoubtedly Christianity is a religion of peace in that we seek to help and not harm people. I witnessed to one man several years ago and his complaint was that he didn’t understand why Christianity was so bloody, and why there is so much talk about blood and death. <strong>It was as if I was a merchant of death, </strong>trying to sell him a message about death. The more I have thought about it, I have come to the realization that Christianity does not cower in the face of death. Instead it is through the reality of death that we can have hope, which is probably a strange conundrum.</p><h2>The Paradise</h2><p>The first mention of death is in the creation of Adam, the first man. God creates man in His own image, places him in the midst of paradise and tells Adam that if he eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that he will “surely die” (Gen. 2:17). The first mention of death, is by God, the Life-Giver. Surely Adam had no idea what the word “die” meant. Perhaps Adam did not completely understand the conclusiveness of which death meant. Because the word “die” reeks of finality.</p><p>Death is not only found on the lips of a creating God, it is wrapped up in the doubts of a subtle serpent. “You will not surely die” was part of the last statement made to Eve before she bit into that fateful fruit (Gen. 2:1-5). The juices had not reached her digestive system before the effects of death began to corrode her spirit and body. “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and death spread to all men” (Rom. 5:12) and “For as by a man came death” (1 Cor. 15:21). Death spread like a disease through Adam and his decedents, for as in Adam all die (1 Cor. 15:22).</p><p>When God came looking for Adam and Eve in the cool of the day, He found them and gave them the promise of redemption, but His message to the serpent was flavored with death: “he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel” (Gen. 3:15b). It would be death that would deliver the final blow to the serpent that would eventually grow into a dragon (Rev. 20:2). How would God bring life to Adam and Eve again? An innocent animal gave its life so they could be clothed in coats of animals skins. Death brought them life. Something paid the debt of sin, so the dividend of life could be given. So it was death that brought them life, and gave them hope.</p><p>Though Adam and Eve did not physcially die that day, they died spiritually. Though Adam lived 930 years, death paid him a visit. For the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23).</p><h2>The Passover</h2><p>The children of Israel were in bondage to Pharaoh and Egypt for 430 years. When God heard their awful cries as their children were being slaughtered He raised up a man by the name of Moses. God would work miracles through Moses. Miracles such as plagues of drought, pestilence and disaster. However the final plague would visit everyone, including the Israelites who dwelt in Goshen (Ex. 11:4-9). The angel of death would come and kill all the firstborn in the land. God gave Moses the plan that every man would have to take a lamb and kill it (Ex. 12:1-12). The shed blood would be painted on the doors posts. Where there was blood applied the angel of death would “passover” that home (Ex. 12:13). Before the death angel visited, there needed to be death in the home. Again death was going to bring life. The death angel needed to see the sign of death applied to the home. It wasn’t enough to just believe the lamb had to be killed, it had to be applied. Again, something innocent took the place for the demise of sin.</p><p>The Children of Israel escaped bondage and death through death. God offered them a way of escape through death.</p><h2>The Priesthood</h2><p>If God was going to have a people who were set apart and distinguishable from the rest of the Ancient Near East, then they would have to have a different set of rules to live by, and place of worship. The Law was given as a standard of living that met the demands of a Holy God. The Tabernacle in the wilderness was a place of holy worship to a Holy God. Worship was shrouded in sacrifice. A holy people must have holy worship, but they cannot be holy unless their sins are atoned for. Sacrifices and offerings were to be made on a altar of fire. Lambs, goats, oxen, and bulls, were to be offered. They would pay the debt of sin, though they were blameless. The Tabernacle with all of its gold and silver and beautiful tapestry smelled of death. The Tabernacle smelled like a crematory, yet it was a sweet savor unto God (Ex. 29:18). If the people wanted to approach God it had to be through the means of blood and death. And if it wasn’t done correctly, that meant death. Forgiveness of sins, worship, service and offerings were through the smoke clouds of death. Shed blood would bring life. Death offered hope. The conundrum continues: to avoid death, you needed to offer death.</p><h2>The Prophets</h2><p>The prophets of the Old Testament were merchants of death. The Israelites failed to practice justice, live faithfully, and keep the Law and the sacrifices. Canaan was vomiting the Israelites out of the land because they did not keep the covenant with Jehovah (Lev. 18:25). Israel’s problem is our problem too. We cannot keep the Law perfectly. Like Israel, we are hopeless to carry out justice, live holy, or be committed to God. Sin’s hold keeps us in darkness. So what was the Lord going to do? He was not going to send a warrior-king to correct Israel and re-establish the kingdom of Israel. No, He was going to send a Suffering-Servant to die. The Root of Jesse, the Son of David, Immanuel-God with us (Is. 7:14; 8:8; Mt. 1:23). He did not come wielding a sword. He was not going to overthrow Egypt, Babylon or Rome. No, He was coming to overthrow the kingdom of darkness. And how would he set captives to darkness free? Through rejection and through death. The Suffering-Servant would bear our griefs, and carry our sorrows. He would be smitten and stricken of God. The Son of David would be pierced for our transgressions, and would be crushed for our iniquities. Why? Because we, like sheep, have gone astray and we have gone our own way (Isa. 53:3-7). Death will bring life. Shed blood will offer salvation. The price of death would be paid with death.</p><h2>The Promised Messiah</h2><p>When the Son of God had come His message was like that which was before him: death. “Except you believe not that I am [he], you shall DIE in your sins” (Jn. 8:24). “Verily I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom” (Mt. 16:28). “He that hears my word and believes on Him that sent me, shall not be condemned but is passed from death unto life” (Jn. 5:24). “If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death” (Jn. 8:51). “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he said signifying what death he should die” (Jn. 12:32-33). “And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer…and be killed, and after three days rise again” (Mk. 8:31). “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (Jn. 2:19). “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you…whoso eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.” (Jn. 6:53-54)</p><p>Christ came to save sinners, but he was going to accomplish it through giving His life (1 Tim. 1:15). How could those who were dead in sin be resurrected back to life? The answer is Christ would die for the ungodly (Rom. 5:6). For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; perhaps for a good man some would even dare die. But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Rom. 5:6-8). Death for death. Death for life.</p><p>Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Nevertheless, Jesus Christ, the sinless Lamb of God, died for sinners that we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21). We were reconciled, made righteous, and redeemed through the death of Jesus Christ. His blood justified us, sanctified us, and will glorify us (Rom. 5:9; 8:30; 1 Cor. 6:11).</p><p>What could stop the reign of death? The death of Jesus Christ! We cry with the Puritan writer, John Owen, “The death of death in the death of Jesus Christ!”</p><p>Christ not only died, he was resurrected from the dead. Death does not have dominion over him (Rom. 6:9) Jesus declared, “I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die” (John 11:25-26). Death was arrested and defeated by Jesus Christ. The resurrection signified the abolishment of death (2 Tim. 1:10).</p><h2>The People of God</h2><p>How can you buy the merchandise of death? How can you get new life? You must die. The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ can be applied to your life. How? Through death. The Apostle Paul was certain of the unity that exists between Jesus Christ and believers through the imagery of baptism. You and I can participate in Christ’s death and resurrection. “<em>Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life</em>” (Romans 6:3–4). Having been buried with Jesus in baptism, we were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead (Colossians 2:12). You can walk in new life, having old things passed away, by crucifying the old way of life (Gal. 5:24). If you walk according to the flesh, which is the old life, then you will die. But if you walk according to the new Spirit living in you, then you will have everlasting life (Rom. 8:13). We no longer live for ourselves, but for the one who died for us (2 Cor. 5:15). Therefore, set your affections on things above, because you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God (Col. 3:2-3).</p><p>Death to sin, and to the old life. But our hope lies in future death. Unlike unbelievers who fear death (Heb. 2:15), we have the hope that if we die we will be with Jesus! With Paul we faithfully say, better to be absent from the body to be with the Lord (2 Cor. 5:8). Death is gain for the believer (Phil. 1:21). The righteous have hope in death (Pro. 14:32). Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints (Ps. 116:15). Not only that, we have the promise that the dead in Christ will rise first at the Second Coming of Jesus (1 Thess. 4:16). Where the mortal will be clothed with immortality and will receive the crown of life on their heads (1 Cor. 15:54; Rev. 2:10).</p><p>Brothers, and sisters, we have hope today! The last enemy to be defeated by Jesus Christ is death (1 Cor. 15:26). Death is swallowed up in victory! O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death has been swallowed up in Christ’s death at calvary, and the victory of the grave has been overthrown by the empty tomb of a resurrected Savior!</p>	100	\N	Merchants of Death	\N	/einar-storsul-hw2wB-Sqg0k-unsplash.jpg
398	2020-08-23 10:38:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>Laziness is a plague that ruins lives, and societies. The book of Proverbs uses the word “sluggard” for the man who will not work or give any effort. The antithesis of the diligent man is the sluggard. The Hebrew word for “sluggard” is defined as a “lazy person, a person who is disinclined to work or exert himself.” In other words, they are sluggish, slothful, and undisciplined. Another translation says they are “lazy bones.” It gives the idea of someone who does not have the willpower to work. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish to eat something and will not even bring it back to his mouth (Pro. 19:24). The sluggard is too lazy to lift food to his mouth! What a tragedy! When you shirk from your responsibilities and will not lift a hand to help yourself then you are considered a sluggard.</p><p>Culture is consistently peddling the erroneous idea that wealth can be achieved without working. Gambling and the lottery have kept more enslaved to poverty than they have made millionaires. But Scripture is clear that if you are going to be blessed, and successful, then you are going to have to work. Laziness will not be blessed. Being a sluggard will not be rewarded.</p><p>The sluggard loves sleep: “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man” (Proverbs 6:10–11). Proverbs 20:13 says, “Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.” Sleep will rob you of time, opportunities, and wealth. Sleep is a like an armed man ready to rob you of opportunities, dreams and ambitions.</p><p>The sluggard makes excuses: “The sluggard says, ‘There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets” (Pro. 22:13)! The sluggard is always making excuses why he can’t go to work. He will imagine all of the dangers that could happen if he were to leave the confines of his bed and go to work.</p><p>The sluggard procrastinates: “The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing” (Pro. 20:4). Instead of plowing at the appointed time, the sluggard procrastinated and ended up having nothing at harvest. If you are always saying “I’ll do it later,” or “I’ll get to it tomorrow,” chances are that you will never get the task completed.</p><p>Beloved, you should do everything in your power to avoid becoming a sluggard. There is nothing rewarding or satisfying about being lazy. You do not honor, nor bring glory to God with laziness. You were created with a purpose. Don’t buy into the lie that laziness is acceptable, or that you’re entitled to certain benefits. The wise man is a man who avoids the path of the sluggard.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 19-21	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-19-21.png
399	2020-08-22 16:58:43	\N	\N	\N	<p>“A friend loveth at all times” (Proverbs 17:17). Friendship is an important topic in Scripture. Abraham was considered the friend of God (Isa. 41:8; Jam. 2:23). The Lord spoke with Moses face to face as friends would (Ex. 33:11). David and Jonathan were very close friends (1 Sam. 18:1-4). Jesus considered the disciples to be His friends (Jn. 15:15). Jesus’ enemies reviled Him because he was friends to publicans and sinners (Mt. 11:19).</p><p>Christians need to be reminded of the value of friendships. Wisdom affects the entirety of life. The wise man knows how to choose good friends, and in turn knows how to be a good friend.</p><p>Believers must be wise in their selection of their friends. Choosing the correct friends may be some of the most important decisions that young men make. The old saying goes “show me your friends and I will show you your future.” Surrounding yourself with the wrong type of people may have detrimental consequences.</p><p>Proverbs says, “whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm” (Pro. 13:20 ESV). The company you keep influences your life and your destiny. Someone once said, “You can’t soar with eagles if you walk with turkeys.” People of all ages have the inherent ability to want to hang out with turkeys.</p><p>You will suffer harm when you fellowship with fools. The New Living Translation records it like this: “associate with fools and get in trouble.” Friends who are always getting themselves into trouble will more than likely get you into trouble too. It’s not a good idea to run with troublemakers and instigators. Your reputation will become vulnerable to scrutiny simply by associating with fools. It is difficult to live wisely if you fraternize with foolish friends.</p><p>Choosing your friends is important, but you must also know the qualities of being a good friend. “A man who has friends must himself be friendly” (Pro. 18:24 NKJV). Being friendly is a necessary attribute if you are going have friends. I have known too many people whose personality and attitude hinders their ability to have any friends. Instead of being friendly, they are like fingernails on a chalkboard, and nobody wants to be around such a person.</p><p>It would be profitable for you to read Proverbs and write down all the wonderful advice it yields concerning friendship. Being a good friend isn’t a sign of weakness or frailty. On the contrary, it is biblical and spiritual for a Christians to have friendships, and to pursue being a good friend.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-16-18.png
400	2020-08-20 22:20:35	\N	\N	\N	<p>Scripture opens with God doing work. God created and worked to bring about all of creation. Each phase of God’s work was considered “good” (Gen. 1:4,10,12,18,21,25,31). Likewise, The book of Proverbs has much to say about work: “Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense” (Pro. 12:11).<br />“From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good, and the work of a man’s hand comes back to him” (Pro. 12:14). “The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor” (Pro. 12:24). “Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth” (Pro. 12:27). “In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty” (Proverbs 14:23).</p><p>Young people who might not yet be in the work force can still learn the value of work. Whether it is in academics, athletics, music, trade skills, or relationships. The blessings are endless for studying hard, practicing often, and putting in time and effort in any discipline. But this must be learned at a young age. The habits that are cultivated now will be hard to break later in life. This holds true for good and bad habits. If you are consistently late when you are young, then you will be consistently late when you are older. The young person who never does their homework and never prepares for tests will have a difficult time doing the tasks when they are assigned while working for an employer. The young person who would rather sleep than take care of their responsibilities will be a slave to sleep when they are older.</p><p>There have been many young people who have not allowed their age to become their excuse for not working. Take Timothy for example. He was probably in his late teens or early twenties when he began traveling with the Apostle Paul. Paul considered Timothy to be his son in the faith (1 Tim. 1:2). Timothy was admired by fellow believers (Acts 16:1-2). He was also part of the growth of the church in Macedonia and Achaia (Acts 17:14-15; 18:5). As a young man, Timothy was left to oversee the largest body of Christian believers which was located in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3). Timothy was not allowed to use youth as a crutch. Instead he was to use his youth to his advantage. If Timothy would take care of his responsibilities, then the elders of Ephesus wouldn’t despise him for his age (1 Tim. 4:12). Timothy was to give his life for the work of the Lord.</p><p>Age is not a qualification for calling or work. The more you discipline your life in your youth, the better off you will be in your later years. Becoming a person of wisdom requires a work ethic.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 13-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-13-15.png
401	2020-08-19 20:54:27	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Proverbs uses the words fool, fools, and foolish at least sixty-nine times. However, the foolish man theme is found in at least one hundred places in Proverbs. The book of Proverbs is not just about becoming wise, it is also about not becoming a fool. There are a myriad of admonishments for wise living, but on the other hand the writer places just as much emphasis on forsaking foolishness. Wisdom isn’t just about growing in knowledge, and information. Wisdom is applying what you have learned. The fool, on the other hand, doesn’t seek knowledge, and therefore does not desire to apply it.</p><p>The word “fool” in the Hebrew is defined as being thick headed and stubborn. A person who will not grow in wisdom is a thick-headed fool. Proverbs gives us at least ten characteristics of a fool.</p><p>The Fool is a Skeptic: “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no god’” (Ps. 14:1). This is perhaps one of the more well-known scriptures concerning the fool. This foolish concept is being peddled in public schools and universities. Christians need to know the basic doctrines of God’s existence (1 Pt. 3:15).</p><p>The Fool Doesn’t Fear the Lord: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction” (Pro. 1:7). Fools disdain wisdom and instruction. The fool who believes there is no God, will not fear that God.</p><p>The Fool is Always Right: “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listen to advice” (Pro. 12:15). Reasonable people will take correction and learn from their mistakes and shortcomings. On the other hand the fool rejects such advice. The foolish man believes that he is always right and everyone else is always wrong.</p><p>The Fool is Reckless and Careless: “One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is reckless and careless” (Pro. 14:16). A wise Christian will be cautious about their behavior and will seek to avoid evil.</p><p>The Fool is Unteachable: “A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only expressing his opinion” (Pro. 18:2). To not have any regard for learning, or growing in knowledge is foolishness. Christians who never read and study Scripture, or who are always distracted during the preaching of God’s Word will undoubtedly fail at spiritual matters.</p><p>The Fool Speaks Foolishly: “The heart of fools proclaim folly” (Pro. 12:23b). Considering that a fool is unteachable, he then will not have anything of value to speak. The fool values his own opinion.</p><p>The Fool Returns to His Sin: “Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly” (Pro. 26:11). Christians who do not forsake their sin are like the dog that returns to his vomit. He returns to what previously made him sick. The gall of guilt should be enough for us to not return to our sin.</p><p>The Fool Lacks Self-Control: “A man of quick temper acts foolishly, and a man of evil devices is hated” (Pro. 14:17). True strength is being able to control yourself rather than be controlled by circumstance and situation. A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls (Pro. 25:28).</p><p>The Fool is Contentious: “A fool’s lips walk into a fight, and his mouth invited a beating” (Pro. 18:6). The young lady who can’t control her emotions, probably doesn’t have the resolve to control her tongue either. Our tongues are a strong muscle, and wise is the woman who learns to control it.</p><p>The Fool Mocks Sin: “Fools make a mock at sin” (Pro. 14:9 KJV). How many people mock and scorn the church? Too often young people are drawn to the rebels who believe Christianity is nothing more than a cosmic killjoy. Those who mock God’s wisdom, will one day be mocked by God while they are in their calamity (Pro. 1:24-26).</p><p>Believers should heed to the many warnings of foolish living. Proverbs doesn’t paint a pretty picture of the outcome of being a fool. It would be wise for Christians to read the book of Proverbs to see just what it means to be a fool.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 10-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-10-12.png
402	2020-08-19 01:08:08	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Proverbs is an invitation to wisdom. Wisdom is not demanding, or bothersome. Instead, Proverbs reveals that the personification of Wisdom is alluring. Wisdom isn’t inconvenient or irritating. Rather, wisdom is as gentle as a dove. Wisdom will not force itself upon you, alternatively, it calls us out and invites all.</p><p>Wisdom cries aloud in the street and in the markets she raises her voice. At the head of the noisy streets she cries out and at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: “How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge” (Prov. 1:20-22). On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand. Beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud: “To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man. O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense” (Pro. 8:1-5). Wisdom has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” To those who lack sense she says, “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight” (Prov. 9:1-6).</p><p>Each time Wisdom is found at places where all can hear her call: at the head of the noisy street by the entrance of the city gates (1:20); beside the gates in front of the town (8:2); calls from the highest places in the town (9:3). Wisdom isn’t hidden where no one can hear her invitation. Rather, Wisdom has made her invitation in the most public of places, where the most people are gathered. But who is Wisdom appealing to? Simple ones (1:22; 8:5; 9:4); men and the children of men (8:4); those who lack sense (9:4); scoffers and fools (1:22; 8:5).</p><p>Based upon where Wisdom is crying out, and to who she is crying out to, we can deduce that any and all are invited to come and partake of Wisdom. Wisdom isn’t just for the wealthy, healthy, beautiful, smart, privileged, and educated. Rather, Wisdom is for whosoever will pursue it.</p><p>Wisdom is inviting everyone to a virtuous life. Wisdom seeks to give everyone the skills needed for everyday living. To obtain wisdom is to acquire prudence and discretion, which brings excellence and success in life.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 7-9	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-7-9.png
403	2020-08-17 21:30:21	\N	\N	\N	<p>“Just follow your heart.” Have you ever heard someone say that? Perhaps you’ve said it yourself. That is terrible advice. If there’s one thing you shouldn’t listen to, it’s your own heart.</p><p>The writer said, &#8220;Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life” (Proverbs 4:23). The word “keep” in the Hebrew means to “guard,” or “protect.” We are to guard our heart with “all diligence.” In other words, you can’t let your guard down on your heart.</p><p>Before we go any further, we need to identify the heart here. Because the heart that is spoken of isn’t the blood pumping muscle within your chest. The reference to the heart here means one’s inner self; or the center of a person’s thoughts, emotions, and mind. From this place called the heart flow the issue of life. You need to guard what you think about. You need to protect your emotions from how something negatively affects you. An unprotected heart is a vulnerable heart. Exposed emotions can become dangerous. If the mind isn’t safeguarded, then it become assailable to attack.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’re a single woman. You don’t protect your mind and it allows negative and oppressive thoughts to go unchecked. For instance, you let your imagination run wild creating negative scenarios, fabricating boogymen and ghosts that paralyze your faith and good sense. Next, your outlook becomes darkened, believing that no good ever happens to you, and life has given you the short end of the stick. Your self-worth becomes depleted because you believe the negative thoughts and scenarios that your emotions have devised. Now you feel lonely and vulnerable, just hoping that something can make it better.</p><p>Along comes an absolute loser of a male specimen, and he begins to show you attention. Your heart and emotions are unprotected, you aren’t thinking clearly, and you decide to date this imbecile. You overlook his destitute spirituality, dreadful dating record, and depleted bank account. Your heart says, “Go for it, you may never find a guy like this again!” So you hastily cry out, “I’m in love!” You’re not in love, you’re desperate. You’ve let your emotions take control, like a petulant toddler driving a semi-truck. Next thing you know, you’re married and your prince has revealed he’s an actual toad who’s only fit for the muddy banks of a fishing pond. He doesn’t help with your newborn, because he’s too busy playing video games, and he lost his fifth job in three months because the boss just “doesn’t get it, man.”</p><p>All of this leads to negative thoughts of regret and guilt, and how you wish you would have thought things through before you went on a date with a guy you had to pick up from his stepmom’s house, and he refused to pay for a single meal on a date, but you’re just so glad that he called you “pretty” that one time on a late night phone call.</p><p>All of this could have been avoided had you just guarded your heart and emotions.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-4-6.png
404	2020-08-14 12:04:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Proverbs is not just a divine book filled with quips and maxims for life. The book of Proverbs was written and compiled with the objective that the reader can know wisdom and instruction; to understand words of insight, to gain instruction in righteousness, justice and equity. The proverbs are also are written to give prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the youth (Pro. 1:2-4).<br />Many of the proverbs are written from the vantage point of a father who seeks to instruct his young son (Pro. 1:8-19; 3:1-12; 4:1-27). The young son is to take his father’s advice that he might mature into manhood. Such a son is his father’s delight (Pro. 15:20). A father intends to teach and train his son in the way that he should go in hopes that the son, when grown, will never depart from those teachings (Pro. 22:6).</p><p>The Hebrew word for “proverb” means “to rule.” The reader is to be ruled by the divine instructions that are written. These are words to live by. Like all of divine Scripture, the proverbs are profitable for the reader (2 Tim. 3:16). Reading, hearing, and obeying the teaching found within Proverbs will make one wise. On the other hand if the reader rejects the wisdom found in the book, they are considered fools. The book of Proverbs contrasts those who are wise with those who are foolish. The father intends to raise a wise man, and not a fool.</p><p>Wisdom is not just for senior citizens who have lived a full life. It is clear that the proverbs teach that even the youth can be wise. It is godly and spiritual to desire to be wise. James wrote that if we lack wisdom we can petition God to grant us wisdom (Jam. 1:5). God is capable of giving wisdom because He is wise (Rom 16:27; Jude 25) Godly wisdom is pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy, fruitful, and it is without partiality and hypocrisy (Jam. 3:17). Such wisdom is to be desired by the aged as well as by the young. When James says we are to “ask of God” when we lack wisdom, the Greek word for “ask” means to “beg, call for, or crave.”</p><p>Christians of all ages and status should crave godly wisdom. The tides of culture bring new challenges, and the Christian needs godly wisdom to help him navigate through those challenges. As the culture trades truth for tolerance, the Christian needs a wisdom that can only come from God. The type of wisdom that young people need will not be found in the halls of the universities, but it will be found upon their knees in prayer with open Bibles.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Proverbs 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Proverbs-1-3.png
405	2020-08-13 15:29:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Psalms begin with God blessing man, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly” (Ps. 1:1) The conclusion of Psalms is a command for man to bless God (Ps. 150). Studying the Psalms we see an interesting flow in how it’s compiled. In the early sections of the Psalms we read psalms of sadness and lament. Followed by psalms of suffering, trouble and difficulty. We relate to those psalms because we identify with the pain of the human condition living in a fallen world. But as you begin to move through the Psalms, the psalms of lament give way to psalms of joy, thanksgiving and praise. The life of a Christian is complex and the psalms help us to sing, weep, and praise.</p><p>The final psalm reveals the priority of praise in the life of a Christian. This short and powerful psalm includes the where, why, how, and who of praise.</p><p>“Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power” (Ps. 150:1). Here we have the where of praise. First, the psalmist said to praise God in His sanctuary. One of the main reasons why we attend church is to give praise unto the Lord. A community of believers are to corporately praise God together. Next, we are to praise God under the heavens. The firmament is literally the cosmos, the expanse of the entire universe. Collectively we praise him when we gather as assembled saints in His presence. Individually we praise Him anywhere and everywhere in His entire universe.</p><p>“Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness” (Ps. 150:2). This is the “why” of praise. God is worthy of praise due to his “mighty acts” or his “acts of power.” The psalmist is referring to God’s divine acts or his deeds. What acts of God are recorded in Scripture? By his spoken word He created everything (Ps. 33:6). He sent His Word and healed diseases (Ps. 107:20). He was light in the darkness (Ps. 18:28). He was a refuge for the oppressed (Ps. 9:9). He provided manna in the wilderness (Ps. 78:24). He provided water from the rock (Ps. 114:8). He loaded Israel down with benefits (Ps. 68:19). He was a shepherd that took care of His flock (Ps. 23:1). Furthermore, what has God done for you? Give Him praise for it!</p><p>Next, the Psalmist instructs saints how to praise. In other words, he gives the means of praise. These would be familiar instruments and expressions used by Jews in their musical praise. Stringed instruments, woodwinds, drums, cymbals, organs, and even dancing are employed for praise (Ps. 150:3-5).</p><p>Finally he says, “Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord” (Ps. 150:6). The simplest qualification for being a person of praise is simply having breath in your body. You don’t have to be a trained musician. You don’t have to be a talented singer. You don’t have to be skilled or gifted. The only qualification for praise is having breath in your body. If you are breathing, then you can praise Him!</p><p>Beloved, the writer is removing any excuse to not praise the Lord. You can praise the Lord in the sanctuary. You can praise the Lord wherever you are in the world. You can praise Him for what He has done, or you can praise Him for who He is. You can praise Him on stringed instruments, wind instruments, soft instruments, or loud instruments. You can praise Him as long as there is breath in your body!</p><p>Do whatever you can, just praise ye the Lord!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 146-150	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-146-150.png
406	2020-08-12 21:27:58	\N	\N	\N	<p>One of Abraham’s characteristics that stood out to the Lord was that he would direct his children and family to keep the way of the Lord (Gen. 18:19). Being a person of faith means imparting the knowledge of God into the next generation. What good was Abraham’s faith if it was only for him? Others needed the same knowledge of the Holy as Abraham had.</p><p>The psalmist wrote, “One generation shall praise thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts” (Psalm 145:4). It is every biblical Christian’s responsibility to make sure the next generation knows of God’s mighty acts. God has fully revealed Himself in His Word, but it is up us, as Christians, to be sure to open the Word up and share it with others. The thought of sharing the gospel with a stranger may frighten you. That’s a rather common fear. Approaching someone you don’t know, to tell them about Jesus is fraught with uncertainties. Will they reject me? Will an argument ensue? What if they ask me something I don’t have the answer to? What if I sound ignorant? Such uneasiness causes many to avoid sharing their faith with strangers.</p><p>Missionary C.T. Studd said, “The light that shines farthest shines brightest nearest home.” You don’t have to travel to a far and distant land in order to be a missionary. The great commission begins in the home. The next generation of disciples can be found in the bedroom down the hall.</p><p>Notice what the psalmist doesn’t say. He doesn’t say “One generation shall vaguely mention thy works to another.” Nor does he say, “One generation shall boringly tell of thy works to another.” Rather he says, “One generation shall praise thy works to another.” Nobody buys anything from a boring salesman. Fortune 500 companies don’t spend millions of dollars for a sad advertisement. Potential buyers want to hear the good things about a product. They want to know how that product could make their life better.</p><p>Beloved, the next generation needs to hear about the mighty works of the Lord! They need to hear you talk of the goodness of the Lord! Then one day they will turn around and tell another generation of the mighty acts of God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 140-145	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-140-145.png

You don’t believe me? Just ask a group of two to three people what restaurant they want to go eat at. Ask another group what brand of car is best. You’re likely to hear a myriad of suggestions, and arguments. That’s because individuals have opinions and preferences. Unfortunately, our individualism doesn’t get left in the parking lot when we enter into a group.</p><p>Now think about a unified group. Give a group, made up of individuals, an idea that they can all agree upon and they can make an impact. United they stand, and divided they fall. The psalmist can boldly proclaim, “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.” There’s a lot to unpack in this statement. Dwell together in unity? Has the psalmist ever been on a road trip with his family? Has the psalmist ever attended a church board meeting? Has the psalmist ever lived with female family members in a house with one bathroom?</p><p>Dwelling together in unity is only made possible when you consider one another as brothers and sisters. Most churches, and ministries within churches, lack unity because they fail to see each other as brothers and sisters. Instead, they’d rather cling to personal preferences and opinions than allow the greater good of the group to prevail. They’d rather see brothers and sisters in Christ as opponents to their agenda, than to subject themselves to unity. This is where seeds of gossip and backbiting are planted. In order to keep power, they attract those who agree with their opinion and then attempt to destroy those who disagree. The church is not unified with a multiplicity of cliques. The church can only become unified when we recognize that God is our Father, and that His agenda takes precedence over everything else.</p><p>Pause the next time someone in the church disagrees with you, and recognize that they are your siblings in Christ. Check your motives and spirit before you overreact. Anybody can be disagreeable and contentious. But, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers and sisters in Christ to dwell together in unity!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 133-139	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-133-139.png
408	2020-08-09 13:18:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Christian life consists of ups and downs, and highs and lows. There are times of joy and weeping. Unfortunately, this reality gets neglected in most evangelistic campaigns. The gospel can change your life, but it isn’t a vaccine for life’s disappointments. Rather, the gospel is the antidote to issues and tribulations. In other words, the gospel changes your perspective, but it doesn’t necessarily immunize you from afflictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Psalm 126 gives us a glimpse into the Christian life. It begins with rejoicing: “When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, We were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; Whereof we are glad” (Psalm 126:1–3). The Lord had restored the good fortunes of Jerusalem. Commentators are unsure of which historical event the psalmist is referring to. But at some point freedom had returned to Jerusalem. Laughter, singing, and gladness are emotions we feel when we experience victory. We can all remember what it was like to experience freedom from sin and guilt. We wanted to tell everyone about it, so they could experience it too!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Notice what happens next: “Turn again our captivity, O Lord, As the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him” (Psalm 126:4–6). From liberty to captivity. From singing to weeping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Circumstances can change overnight. One minute you’re rejoicing over your freedom. And the next moment you’re weeping at your captivity. But your tears are not in vain. Tears are water, and the seeds of joy are watered from the tears of weeping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Beloved, weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning (Ps. 30:5)!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 126-132	\N	/D4C5B76B-B250-47D6-843B-54AE82A82837.png
409	2020-08-09 00:25:56	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psalm 120 marks the beginning of a group of psalms known as the Psalms of Ascent or Psalms of Degree (Ps. 120-134). These songs were sung by Israelite pilgrims as they journeyed up the hill of Jerusalem to celebrate holidays such as the Feast of Booths, Festival of Weeks, and the Passover. Jerusalem, also known as Mount Zion and the City of David, was the place that God had chosen to put His name (2 Kings 23:27).</p><p>In the Old Testament, the first mention of Jerusalem is in reference Melchizedek, king of Salem (Gen. 14:18). Details are scarce about the city at that particular time. Later we find the city inhabited by the Jebusites. When David became king of Israel, he removed the Jebusites and established Jerusalem as Israel’s capital (2 Sam. 5:6-12). Once David had secured Jerusalem, he brought the Ark of the Covenant to be housed in the Tabernacle (2 Sam. 6:12-19). Later the Temple erected in Jerusalem under the leadership of Solomon.</p><p>Psalm 122 is one of the songs that would be sung as Israelites traversed toward Jerusalem. They would joyfully proclaim, “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord” (Ps. 122:1). They were rejoicing on their way to God’s house. Keep in mind, that such a journey for many Jews was difficult. Unlike today, there were no modern conveniences of air travel or driving a minivan to Jerusalem. They were walking or riding a beast of burden. Furthermore, they would be bringing animals for the sacrifices. Traveling to Jerusalem was a demanding undertaking.</p><p>In the 21st Century we have all the modern conveniences of travel. Add to that the benefit of churches on every corner, that are equipped with air conditioning, and in-door plumbing. Churches are doing everything they can to make the church inviting and allow people to feel comfortable. And we should be glad about it! Despite the advancements of technology and convenience, there will always people who resent attending church services. There are those whose personal preferences and inclinations aren’t met, so they’d rather just find another church or not attend one at all. Such attitudes are a detriment to one’s soul and family.</p><p>Perhaps we should be thankful for what God has done for the church in the 21st Century, and become like the Old Testament Jews and say, “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord!”</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 120-125	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-120-125.png
410	2020-08-05 14:39:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psalm 119 is the longest chapter in the Bible with 176 verses. This lengthy psalm has one subject: the Word of God. The writer of this amazing psalm was saturated with his subject. If this psalmist was indeed King David, we can understand why he was a man after God’s own heart. For David’s heart delighted in God’s Word. The Scripture, to this writer, was no strange thing. The Word of God was considered great. The doctrines, laws and precepts were not considered to be alien.</p><p>There are at least six synonyms used for Scripture in this measurable chapter. Law: It was employed of a single command or the whole body of the Law of Moses (Ps. 119:18). Testimonies: This word is used in reference to when the Law was placed in or near the Ark of the Covenant, and signified its “witness” (Ps. 119:103). Precepts: This particular word is drawn from the sphere of an officer, overseer, or one who had the responsibility to look into a matter closely and take action. When used in the Old Testament it is in reference to particular instructions from the Lord (Ps. 119:93). Statutes: This speaks of the binding power and permanence of Scripture as inscribed laws (Ps. 119:16). Commandments: This word emphasizes the authority of what God has said, and includes His absolute authority (Ps. 119:35). Judgments: This Hebrew word speaks of God as a Judge of His laws (Ps. 119:164).</p><p>Notice how the writer delights in the Word of God. His one desire is to understand and keep the commandments of God. The writer of Psalm 119 would rather have the Word of God than food (Psalm 119:103)! He would rather have God’s Word than wealth (Psalm 119:72; 127). He would rather study God’s Word than sleep (Psalm 119:147–148). He would choose the Word of God over hanging out with bad friends (Psalm 119:115).</p><p>Furthermore, the Word of God yields great rewards. How can a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed to God’s Word (Ps. 119:9). How can you keep yourself from being offended? By loving the Law of God (Psalm 119:165). How can you learn to hate evil? Through esteeming all of Scripture (Psalm 119:128) Hiding the Word of God in your heart will assist you in fighting against sin (Ps. 119:11). You can become a person of praise with God’s Word (Ps. 119:17). And you can be blessed if you will love the Word of God with your whole heart (Ps. 119:2, 56).</p><p>Beloved, the Word of God is great! This Book is not strange, its words are not strange, its principles and precepts are not strange, and its witness of the One True God is not strange. Rather, the Word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path (Ps. 119:105).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalm 119	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-119.png
411	2020-08-05 03:11:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>Genesis 1:26-27 indicates that God created humans to be His image bearers. Unfortunately, sin ruined humanity’s ability to fully bear the image of God. Sin caused true worship to become distorted. In other words, man began to worship creation more than the Creator (Rom. 1:21-25). Not only did humanity began to worship creation, they began to create their own gods. This is why the Lord commanded Israel not to worship any other gods, whether it was creation or created idols: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me” (Exodus 20:3-5).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The psalmist condemns idols and those who make and worship them: “Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not: Eyes have they, but they see not: They have ears, but they hear not: Noses have they, but they smell not: They have hands, but they handle not: Feet have they, but they walk not: Neither speak they through their throat” (Psalm 115:4–7). Idols do not have the ability to speak, see, hear, smell, handle, or move. They are nothing more than dumb idols.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Notice the consequence of making and worshiping idols: “They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them” (Ps. 115:8). Those who make idols become just like them. To say it another way, they become what they worship. Bible scholar GK Beale says, “What people revere, they resemble, either for ruin or restoration.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If we revere the world, then we will become like the world. If we revere celebrities, we will reflect the worldly lifestyles they exhibit.

412	2020-08-04 02:28:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>Charles Darwin had an exceptional ability to observe and study. During his maiden voyage to South America, he took a copious amount of notes concerning the wildlife he observed. His ability to discover, examine, and think led to the ideas that would shape the world of thinking and science for generations to come. When he returned to England five years later, his family had noticed a physical change in him. His whole manner was different &#8211; a seriousness of purpose and sharpness could be read in his eyes, the exact opposite of how he looked before he left for South America. The voyage, and constant study had transformed Darwin in body and spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The works of the Lord are great, studied by all who have pleasure in them” (Psalm 111:2 NKJV). The word “studied” in the Hebrew means to “enquire,” “investigate,” or “seek with great care.” Charles Darwin had an insatiable desire to study and observe. As Christians we should study and enquire the things of the Lord. But what type of things? The psalmist said, “the works of the Lord.” Certainly we should begin with studying the Word of God. In my opinion, Scripture is the greatest of God’s works. Without it, our knowledge of God would be greatly limited. However, God has given us His Word that we might know Him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A casual reading of Scripture doesn’t yield its treasures. Concerning reading the Bible, Pastor John Piper wrote, “Raking leaves is easy, but you only get leaves. Digging is hard work, but you might find diamonds.” If you want to know about Jesus Christ, the best thing to do is study more about Him. For instance in the Gospels, observe His character. What type of people did He choose to associate with? What made Him angry? Who did He love? What was His purpose? What did He say when He taught? These are just a few questions we can ask as we study the Word of God and draw closer to Jesus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Beloved, once you have begun the life-long journey to study the works of the Lord, people will notice a change in you, like Charles Darwin’s family noticed in him. Hopefully the changes that will be noticed, is that you have become more like Christ.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>	100	\N	Psalms 108-114	\N	/4EB82305-9FD1-4A36-8823-FD23E1D72C1C.png

The Hebrew word for “redeemed” means to “buy back,” “deliver,” “save,” or “reclaim as one’s own.” This is the same word used when God delivered Israel from Egypt (Ex. 6:6). It’s the very word employed when someone redeemed a piece of land, or if a slave was set free (Lev. 25). And it was used in reference to Boaz when he redeemed Ruth, as the kinsman-redeemer (Ruth 3:19-4:14). The theme of redemption is a familiar theme all through the Old Testament.</p><p>Psalm 107 uses four word-pictures of human circumstances and divine deliverance: wanderers reclaimed (107:4-9); prisoners released (107:10-16); the sick recovered (107:17-22); and the storm-tossed rescued (107:22-32). Each of these metaphors reveal God’s ability to redeem humanity from their circumstantial plight.</p><p>The response to God’s redemption was praise: “Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men” (107:8;15;21; 31). The redeemed were to praise the Lord for His goodness and mercy (107:1). Wanderers who had been found were to praise the Lord. Prisoners who had been freed were to praise the Lord. The sick who had been healed were to praise the Lord. Those rescued from the storms of life were to praise the Lord. They were to say so!</p><p>Your testimony is the greatest tool for witnessing. Tell someone how the Lord found you when you were lost. Share your story about being set-free from bondage. Testify about God healing your sin-sick heart or from poor health. Open your mouth and proclaim that God rescued you from despair. Someone might be in need of God’s redemption!</p><p>In other words, let the redeemed of the Lord say so!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 106-107	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-106-1071.png
414	2020-08-02 00:56:41	\N	\N	\N	<p>There are times, as a pastor, that it can become a chore getting people to worship the Lord. Which, in all honesty, is tragic. I believe one reason people become apathetic towards worship is that they forget who God is. David wrote, “Bless the Lord, O my soul: And all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits” (Psalm 103:1–2). Why is it difficult to keep people enthused about worship? They forget all of His benefits! We need to remind our souls and hearts of God’s benefits. Let’s look at some of those benefits outlined in Psalm 103.</p><p>God forgives all of our sins and iniquities (103:3a). He heals all of our diseases (103:3b). He has redeemed us from destructions (103:4a). God crowns us with lovingkindness and everlasting mercy (103:4b). He satisfies our longings with good things (103:5).</p><p>Those are some amazing benefits! Have your sins be forgiven? Bless the Lord! Has He ever healed your body? Bless the Lord! Did He deliver you from self-destruction? Bless the Lord! Has the Lord extended mercy to your life? Bless the Lord! Do you have food in your cupboard? Do you have a roof over your head? Do you have clothes on your back? Shoes on your feet? Then He has satisfied you with good things. Bless the Lord!</p><p>God is deserving of worship based on those benefits. On the other hand, God is worthy to be worshiped based on who He is. He executes righteousness and judgement for the oppressed (103:6). He has made His ways known (103:7) He is merciful, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy (103:8). He hasn’t dealt with us according to our sin nor to our iniquities (103:10). As far as the east is from the west, He has removed our sin far from us (103:12). He is like a Father who pities His children (103:13).</p><p>Think upon these benefits the next time you find it difficult to worship the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalm 103-105	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-103-105.png
415	2020-07-30 10:37:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psalms 96 is in the middle of a series of psalms that celebrate the worship God (Ps. 93-99). The psalm includes imperatives like “sing,” “declare,” and “give.” Worship involves using your emotions and opening your mouth. Whether you can hold a tune or not, it’s important to make a joyful noise unto the Lord, for He is worthy of such adoration.</p><p>The psalmist adds, “O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: Fear before him, all the earth” (Psalm 96:9). Surely the psalmist is invoking Temple imagery, for the Temple was a beautiful structure within and without. Likewise, the priests were to be adored in beautiful attire. The Hebrew word for “holiness” can refer to moral purity or being set apart for God and His purposes. Is it any wonder that God, who is holy, made His dwelling place holy, and desired for His people to be holy? The ph</p><p>Holiness isn’t synonymous with being homely. Holiness is beautiful. Being set apart for God isn’t some cosmic killjoy. On the contrary, holiness and worship should be joyful. This psalm says, “be glad,” “rejoice,” and “be joyful” (Ps. 96:11-12). It might be a good idea to let your face know that serving God is joy unspeakable and full of glory! Perhaps if you smiled more in public and acted like you had something that the world didn’t give, and the world can’t take away, then perhaps more people would desire what you have!</p><p>Worship and holiness go hand in hand. The apostle Paul wrote, “I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting” (1 Tim. 2:8). God deserves splendid worship and holiness, because He is holy.</p>	100	\N	Psalms 96-102	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-96-102.png
416	2020-07-26 22:01:55	\N	\N	\N	<p>There’s a difference between being a visitor and being an inhabitant. One only visits a place every once in awhile. The other lives at a particular place for a prolonged period of time. When it comes to the secret place of God, are you an inhabitant or merely a visitor? Because in order for you to claim the promises of Psalm 91, then you must be an inhabitant of God’s presence. “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty…Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation.” Notice the words “dwelleth” “abide” and “habitation.” This is no stopover at God’s house on your spiritual journey. On the contrary, this is staying put and staying for as long as possible. For some so-called Christians this is difficult to do. They only visit God’s presence on holidays. Treating God like he’s some distant uncle who they only have to appease with their presence every once in awhile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If you will dwell in the secret place, then the Lord will be your God, refuge, fortress, shield, buckler, and habitation. Furthermore, He will deliver you from every trap, and deadly disease (Ps. 91:3); cover you with His wings (91:4); multitudes may fall all around, but you will be protected (91:7); no evil or plague shall befall you (91:10); and He will commission His angels to guard you (91:11).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Beloved, don’t just be an infrequent visitor to God’s secret place.

417	2020-07-24 19:19:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>There are times we just don’t know how to pray for a situation. The apostle Paul said the Holy Spirit can assist us in praying when we don’t know exactly how to pray for a situation: “Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with gleanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26).</p><p>Then there are simple prayers like we find in Psalm 86: “Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name” (Ps. 86:11). A simple, yet deep prayer.</p><p>Keep in mind the way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord (Prov. 15:9). The way of the transgressor is hard (Prov. 13:15). The way of the ungodly leads to destruction (Ps. 1:6). On the other hand, The way of the Lord is strength to the righteous (Prov. 10:29). The way of the Lord leads to everlasting life (Jer. 21:8). Furthermore, the way of the Lord is a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ (Jn. 14:6). Jesus Christ is not only the Way, but He is also the Truth. Knowing Jesus isn’t just an exercise in intellectual ascent, it is lived out in faith and obedience. The apostle John wrote, “If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth” (1 Jn. 1:6).</p><p>David said, “unite my heart to fear thy name.” The word “unite” in the Hebrew is “yached,” meaning “to make one.” The remedy for a wandering or divided heart is to be united to Jesus Christ. It is easy for our affections to be split between the world and the Lord. A prayer like David’s where he realizes that he must remain in the Lord or he will wander down the wrong path, should be a petition that we pray daily.</p><p>Beloved, let us pray today that we may know God’s ways, walk in His truth, and have our hearts and affections united with Him.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 86-89	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-86-89.png
418	2020-07-24 02:20:05	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psalm 81 begins with a call to worship with musical instruments. The call for worship is in reference to a feast day. It is quite possible the feast day in question was the Feast of Tabernacles. The festival began with the sounding of the trumpet on the first of the month at the new moon (Ps. 81:3). The Feast of Tabernacles would be held in the middle of the month, in which Israelite families would dwell in tabernacles made of foliage (Lev. 23:33-43; Deut. 31:10). The Feast of Tabernacles (also called Feast of Booths) was designed to remember the the forty year wilderness journey from Egypt to Canaan. Israel’s grumbling, complaining, and unbelief prolonged their journey. When they should have went directly into the Promised Land from Egypt, their lack of faith kept them in the wilderness for forty years, inevitably losing an entire generation.</p><p>The wilderness is an important theme in the Bible. In the New Testament the first voice we hear is that of John the Baptist crying in the wilderness (Matt. 3:16). He calls for all of Israel to come to the wilderness to repent and be baptized. Such an event would make Jewish listeners call to mind Moses leading the Israelites in the wilderness. Jesus’ first act in public ministry was to go into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil for forty days (Matt. 4:1-11). Just as Moses had led the Israelites in the wilderness for forty years due to their sin, Jesus is driven by the Spirit to the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Echos of Moses’ rebellion of striking the rock at Meribah might be found in the devil tempting Jesus to turn the stones into bread.</p><p>If you’re like me, you might imagine the wilderness being like a forest. However, the wilderness in the Bible was in reference to the desert. The desert can’t support human life. You can’t grow, or hunt for much food in the desert. Furthermore, you can’t find a sustainable amount of water. The only reason that Israel didn’t perish in the wilderness was due to God’s provision. He was the cloud by day, and the fire by night. He provided manna from heaven, and gave them water from a rock.</p><p>If it hadn’t been for the wilderness, then perhaps Israel would have never known the Lord. Certainly that is true for us as well. Had it not been for the life-draining moments spent in the wilderness of life, then we would have never known God to be the Life Source that we needed. Truly, He has been honey from the rock (Ps. 81:16).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 80-85	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-80-85.png
419	2020-07-22 12:41:23	\N	\N	\N	<p>History is one of the greatest teachers. It may not be everyone’s favorite subject, but history is definitely important. George Santayana said of history, “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”</p><p>The beginning of Psalm 78 says it is a &#8220;maschil of Asaph” The word “maschil” is the Hebrew word for instruction, meaning this is an instructional psalm. Asaph, the writer of this psalm, was teaching a new generation by warning them of the previous generation’s failures. The previous generation was stubborn and rebellious. They had not set their heart to seek after God (Ps. 78:8). The tribe of Ephraim was one example of not being steadfast. “The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them” (Ps. 78:9-11).</p><p>Ephraim’s name, given to him by his father, Joseph, means “fruitful.” Out of Ephraim came heroes and leaders like Joshua, Gideon, and the prophet Samuel. Ephraim became a leading tribe for Israel. The men of Ephraim were proficient with bow and arrows.</p><p>Furthermore, Ephraim was a tribe of honor and glory at their beginnings. They marched next to the Ark according to Numbers 2:18. Ephraim encamped next to the Tabernacle. They were a strong warrior tribe that could protect the Ark and the Tabernacle. Ephraim was so great at protecting the Ark and Tabernacle that when Israel conquered the promised land, Ephraim set up and took over Shiloh, and it was in Shiloh that the Ark and Tabernacle would be set up, and remained for the next four hundred years.</p><p>Despite all of Ephraim’s exploits and honor, they turned back in the day of battle. Most Bible commentators believe this was the battle with the Philistines found in 1 Samuel chapter four. How could a tribe with so much capability turn its back and desert the battle?<br />Likewise, how can the Church, with all of its splendor and ability, run and hide in this hour of battle? Like Ephraim, we have everything we need. We have the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. We have Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords on our side. Paul said, if God be for us who can be against us? Jesus said, the gates of hell would not prevail against the Church.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this is no time to turn our backs and run! This is our time to step up and defend the Word of God. Let us not have the ghost of Ephraim haunt us. We are armed, and are willing to fight and give diligence to doctrine, to the faith, and protect what God and previous generations have entrusted to us.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 78-79	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalms-78-79.png
420	2020-07-21 20:22:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>The human memory is one of the great wonders of the world. We stand in amazement when someone shows off their great memory, either by quoting something verbatim, or recalling minute information like some wizard from a fairy tale. Such rare feats of achievement cause bewilderment because the majority of us can’t remember where we set our keys down the night before. I can barely recall what I ate for lunch yesterday. It seems the older I get, the less and less space is available in my memory’s hard drive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In Psalm 77 there are several references to remembering and forgetting. David, again, is wearied and complaining. He seems to think that God has forgotten how to be gracious (Ps. 77:9). It’s as if David believes that God has forgotten him. There are times when we certainly think those types of thoughts. Problems and issues erupt like volcanos and we wonder where in the world is God in all of this. Sometimes we seek the Lord for an answer and only to get a busy signal. “God can you please take my call?! Have you forgotten about me?” God hadn’t forgotten David, and neither has He forgotten us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Instead of getting upset and giving up, David reminded himself of the Lord’s previous works. David said, “And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings” (Ps. 77:10-12).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Our memories need to be refreshed daily. If we don’t consistently remind ourselves of God’s goodness, and prior works on our behalf, then we will forget to be grateful, and fool ourselves to believe that God has forsaken us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Think back and remember what God has done for you in your lifetime. Hasn’t He been faithful? Hasn’t He been good to you? If He was there before, then He’ll be there again.

421	2020-07-20 12:35:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>There’s no doubt God is good to His people. He takes care of us, and provides our every need. But it’s easy to overlook and take for granted sometimes. Especially when we see unrighteous people prospering. We think they have it all despite their evil ways. Why do they prosper? How can they get away with their behavior? Doesn’t God see their actions? Why do I have to live this way, and obey God’s laws?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Have you ever thought like that? I know I have. And we are in good company, because Asaph, the writer of Psalm 73, felt the same way. Asaph said, “But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked” (Ps. 73:2-3). According to Asaph the wicked live painless, carefree lives. Trouble alludes them. They’re clothed with pride and arrogance. They speak foolishly and scoff at the thought of God. These fat cats have everything they could ask for! And where is God?</p><p>Asaph added, “Did I keep my heart pure for nothing? Did I keep myself innocent for no reason? I get nothing but trouble all day long; every morning brings me pain” (Ps. 73:13-14 NLT). Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Honestly, these very thoughts and words spilled from my heart just recently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s easy to believe the lie that God doesn’t care about the wicked and their wrongdoing. The issue is that we are only looking at our present plight and the wicked’s present prosperity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Asaph said, “When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end” (Ps. 73:16-17). Once Asaph had come to the sanctuary of God’s dwelling place, he realized the eventual destiny of the unrighteous. One of these days, God is going to bring swift judgment and condemnation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Asaph realized his foolish thinking, and was reminded of God’s great care for His people. He concluded and said, “Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory” (Ps. 73:23-24).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Brothers and sisters, let us not lose sight of our reward for righteous living.

422	2020-07-19 11:42:49	\N	\N	\N	<p>The word “Selah” appears only in the book of Psalms and Habakkuk. “Selah” is found multiple times in today’s readings. But what does that word mean? Bible commentators do not all agree on the meaning of the Hebrew word. Some believe that “Selah” was used to inform musicians to change instruments, or to change the tempo of the song. Another said it was a call for hearers to fall on their face and worship the Lord. The majority of Bible scholars, however, believe the word meant to rest and reflect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rest and reflect doesn’t seem quite as easy to accomplish as it used to. Busy is the new normal. But busy doesn’t necessarily mean we are accomplishing anything of importance. Most of the time we are busy with trifles that eat up our time, and then when we really need to get something done we realize we’ve wasted precious opportunities. Oh, that doesn’t happen to you? Just me? Well you might need to rest and reflect on that a a little while.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>What might we rest and reflect on? Though the psalmists were divinely inspired to write the Word of God, there were times when something so magnificent or weighty was said that readers and hearers needed to rest and reflect on the saying before moving on to the next phrase. For instance: “All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah” (Psalms 66:4). In other words, “stop what you’re doing and worship the Lord.” “He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah” (Psalms 66:7). Reflect that God has all power, and that you don’t. That should give us pause for a few moments. “God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah” (Psalms 67:1). Do you need mercy? Do you need blessings that only come from above? Rest and reflect on that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Selah is a marker in your reading that you need to read again what you just read in order to rest and reflect upon it. Go back through the Psalms we’ve been reading and mark all the times you see “Selah.” Then rest and reflect on those glorious truths, for you might just find rest for your wearied mind and soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 66-69	\N	/54B439F3-B928-4B66-9186-5710215A2403.png

I’m not sure about you, but I’ve been secretly fighting overwhelming fear over the last few weeks. The incessant negativity that surges from Twitter feeds and news networks feed fear. Like David, where can we turn for relief?</p><p>David said, “From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to to the rock that is higher than I “ (Ps. 61:2).</p><p>The metaphor of God being a rock is common in the Psalms, appearing no less than twenty-five times. Even in the Pentateuch Moses refers to God as a rock (Deut. 32). But why a rock? This is not the type of rock that you can kick down the road. No, this type of rock was a place of refuge, like a cleft in a mountain (Num. 24:21; Judges 15:8; 20:47). We can run to the Rock for refuge. The Lord is the Rock that is higher than any situation. This immovable Rock will be our shelter and comfort.</p><p>I keep thinking of Dottie Rambo’s song <em>I Go to the Rock</em>.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Where do I go when there&#8217;s nobody else to turn to?<br />Who do I turn to when nobody wants to listen?<br />Who do I lean on when there&#8217;s no foundation stable?<br />I go to the Rock, I know He&#8217;s able, I go to the Rock</p><p style="text-align: center;">I go to The Rock for my salvation<br />I go to the stone that the builders rejected<br />I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me<br />When the earth all around me is sinking sand<br />On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand<br />When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the Rock</p><p style="text-align: left;">Brothers and sisters, let us go to the Rock.

424	2020-07-15 17:20:02	\N	\N	\N	<p>There is no doubt that the Christian church is under attack. The Christian worldview is ridiculed daily. Recently, one news anchor said we are to trust in ourselves rather than trust in God. Another television show host claimed that Jesus wasn’t perfect. Christians are commonly called intolerant, and bigoted due to our exclusive belief in Jesus Christ is God, and that His Word is the true standard of morality and righteous living.</p><p>The psalmist wrote, “Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; He fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: For they be many that fight against me, O thou most High” (Psalm 56:1–2). The Hebrew word for “swallow” means to “trample,” “pester,” “to cause to suffer.” David’s enemies longed to crush and defeat him. But if they couldn’t do that then they would try to oppress or torment him.</p><p>The Christian church in North America may not be at that point just yet. But we have brothers and sisters around the world who are daily tormented, oppressed, and even killed. But as North America grows darker with sin, we may relate even more to our oppressed brothers and sisters in Christ.</p><p>“What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his Word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me” (Ps. 56:3-4). Truly fear grips our hearts as we see tribulation approaching. But we should put our trust in God. We shouldn’t fear man, but we should have a holy fear of God. Jesus said, “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matt. 10:28).</p><p>Beloved, as we see the end of time advance don&#8217;t lose hope or allow fear to grip your heart. Instead place your trust in Jesus.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 52-57	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-52-57.png

426	2020-07-13 21:50:41	\N	\N	\N	<p>David’s sin with Bathsheba, and the murder of her husband, are quite the stains on an otherwise illustrious life (2 Sam. 11:1-27).</p><p>From this failure, and the prophetic confrontation that followed, we are given David’s prayer of repentance in Psalm fifty-one.</p><p>David uses three words to describe his failure (Ps. 51:3-5,9,13): transgression, iniquity, and sin. In the original language “transgress” meant “to rebel.” Another definition for transgress is to “go beyond.” David rebelled and went beyond God’s laws and committed adultery and murder, and a whole host of other sins. We become transgressors when we go beyond what God has commanded.</p><p>In Hebrew the word “iniquity” means “perversion” or “crooked dealing.” David’s actions were perverse and depraved. What God declared to be straight, David decided to distort. David’s actions were part of a deeper problem for he notes that he was born with iniquity: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me” (Psalms 51:5).</p><p>The Hebrew definition for “sin” is to “miss the mark” or “fall short.” Paul wrote, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23). What mark did David miss, and what mark do we miss? We miss the mark of God’s character. Paul wrote that our sinful condition leaves us short of God’s glory.</p><p>The psalm begins with David throwing himself upon God’s mercy (Ps. 51:1). David acknowledged that he was in need of forgiveness. The first step towards forgiveness and salvation from our sin is the admission that we need rescued. David’s prayer is teeming with repentance. Guilt is such a heavy burden to carry. David longed to be relieved of such a weight, and cast himself at Jehovah’s feet to find mercy.</p><p>David’s transgression, iniquity and sin were matched with God’s love, mercy, and compassion. But how can God’s mercy, love, and compassion be adequately applied to sinners? Salvation is applied by a gracious God through blotting out, washing thoroughly, and cleansing inwardly.</p><p>David’s sins were committed under the Old Testament, and demanded justice. Here, under the covenant of the Law, David had a first-hand experience with the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was a man acquainted with sin and God’s grace. If you are in need of forgiveness take a few moments to read through Psalm fifty-one and witness the gospel according to David.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 46-51	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-46-51.png
427	2020-07-12 11:11:44	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Stuck. You can get your vehicle stuck in the mud. You could get stuck on a hard question during a test. You could be stuck in a terrible job. There’s many ways we could get stuck. But the worse kind of stuck, is being stuck in the mire of sin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David said, “He brought me out also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings” (Ps. 40:2). David knew what it was like to sink down into the pit of sin. And like getting your car stuck in the mud, the more you try to get yourself out of it, the deeper you sink, and the harder it becomes to get out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s the slime pit of sin. No matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you push or pull, or clinch your teeth and step on the gas, you can’t get out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When we get stuck, we call for help. Jesus is willing to come and bring you out of the sludge of sin. He’ll place your feet on a firm foundation, and give you a new song to sing. I can still hear the hymn He Brought Me Out whenever I read this psalm: “He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!”</p>\r\n	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 40-45	\N	/5CEB4D18-40EC-41C2-B703-EEF747D9958A.png
428	2020-07-11 19:12:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>Scripture is quite practical. As you frequent yourself with the Bible, the more you will notice the obvious imperatives that produce blessings. Psalm 37 is just one of those instances. This psalm presents David’s concern with the prosperity of evildoers. We can certainly relate to David’s quandary in our own day. Wickedness, and lawlessness is increasing, and yet there seems to be little justice. If you don’t know what I mean just turn on the local news, or scroll through Twitter. Corruption, hatred, and depravity has become mainstream, and even legislated.</p><p>Here is David’s advice: “Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be envious against workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like grass, and wither as the green herb” (Ps. 37:1-2). The word “fret” in the Hebrew means “agitated” “angry” or “irritated.” It seems difficult not to get angry with what is happening in the world. Because there is One who is angrier than we could ever be, and that’s God. One of these days the Avenger of Blood is going to vindicate the righteous and punish evildoers if they fail to repent.</p><p>What are we to do in the meantime? David gives the answers. Trust in the Lord (Ps. 37:3); Delight thyself in the Lord (Ps. 37:4); Commit thy way unto the Lord (Ps. 37:5); Rest in the Lord (Ps. 37:7); and Wait upon the Lord (Ps. 37:9,34).</p><p>Trust that God is just. While the world takes pleasure in doing evil, let us delight in the Lord. Commit yourself to God as the world drifts farther and farther from God. Rest in your Savior and don’t fret over the evening news. Finally, wait upon the Lord. Listen to the words of Jesus and find comfort, “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also” (John 14:1–3).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 36-39	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-36-39.png
429	2020-07-11 17:36:41	\N	\N	\N	<p>The blessed person is a forgiven person. “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile” (Ps. 32:1–2). This is the second Psalm to begin with “blessed.” The first time was in Psalm 1: “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful” (Ps. 1:1). There the blessed man is one who refuses to walk in the way of sinners. Here in Psalm 32 the blessed man is one who has walked in the way of sinners, yet has repented and finds forgiveness.</p><p>Before David’s repentance, his bones cried within him, and he lost sleep. Is there anything worse than shame, guilt, and conviction? Those feelings are a constant thorn to the conscience. Many try to find other sources to relieve themselves of past mistakes. They turn to substance abuse, bad relationships, or overworking. Anything to silence the torment of guilt.</p><p>But here is the answer in this instructional psalm: “I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him” (Psalm 32:5–6).</p><p>Acknowledge, uncover, and confess your sins to the Lord! And He will forgive, cover, and wipe clean the debt of sin!</p><p>I’m not sure there is anything more relieving than confessing your sins and receiving forgiveness. The word “blessed” means “happy.” What joy and happiness can be found in the grace of God!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalm 32-35	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-32-36.png
430	2020-07-11 16:29:06	\N	\N	\N	<p>In the Old Testament, the Temple was considered the “house” where the Spirit of the Lord dwelt (2 Chr. 7:1-3; Ezek. 43:4-5; 44:4). David said, “Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, And the place where thine honour dwelleth” (Psalm 26:8). David loved the house of God. This desire was contrasted against gathering with the ungodly: “I have not sat with vain persons, Neither will I go in with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; And will not sit with the wicked” (Psalm 26:4–5).</p><p>David loved the house of God, but he also desired to dwell within it: “One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple” (Psalm 27:4). The word “dwell” in the Hebrew means to “inhabit,” “remain,” and “be established.” David didn’t just want an acquaintance with the place where God dwelled, but he wanted to be established within it.</p><p>But we should remember, that the Temple wasn’t built until after David’s death. The glory of the Lord dwelt in a tent during the days of David. It wasn’t the grand edifice of Solomon’s day. Rather, the house of God wasn’t much of an aesthetically pleasing beauty. What was within that house is what mattered to David.</p><p>Though the Spirit of the Lord isn’t confined to modern church buildings, it is the corporate gathering place of God’s people. There in that place we worship, sing, and adore our God (Heb. 10:25). But it is important that we love the One who fills the house. Your place of worship may not be a physically grand edifice that stands out within your city, but you should love it and want to be established within it. Don’t just love the thought of church, but get in it and remain in it.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalm 26-31	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-26-31.png
431	2020-07-09 14:20:28	\N	\N	\N	<p>Psalm 23 has been labeled the &#8220;Pearl of the Psalms.&#8221; This wonderful psalm has the aroma of continuous peace, secure tranquility, jubilant trust, and assured calm. Not even the shadow of death troubles the psalmist. Psalm 23 has dried many tears and supplied much hope.</p><p>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.” The opening verse of the twenty third Psalm is a profound commitment to the Lord as the source of security in the midst of many dangers without any other assistance. Without hesitation, sheep confidently follow the shepherd, knowing with him leading all will be well. The Christian’s pilgrimage isn’t quite like the lamb of the Ancient Near East, but our pilgrimage is met with dangers. Disease, poverty, fear, violence, and uncertainty can meet us in this day and age. Our trust, however, remains in the Good Shepherd.</p><p>“He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.” A dog can be trained to sit and to lie down. That’s not the case with sheep. No one can make a sheep lie down. Sheep will only lie down when they have had plenty to eat, have quenched their thirst and are not threatened by any wild animal or disturbed by irritating insects. The barking of a dog can cause an entire flock to jump up and run off if not stopped by an alert shepherd. In essence sheep will only rest when they know the shepherd has led them faithfully.</p><p>Sheep have a tendency to wander off from their shepherd. Now, this is a very important part of the chapter. Our English translations do not translate this phrase, “He restoreth my soul” very well. Often we use this verse to soothe people’s wearied mind and soul. It’s used as a salve for the depressed and oppressed. However, this is not exactly the correct usage or translation. Keeping in mind this is the Shepherd and the lamb.</p><p>I asked a Lebanese friend to send me the translation of his Arabic Bible of verse three. His Arabic Bible and the Hebrew translation are the same. The correct translation is, “He brings back.”</p><p>The literal translation “he brings me back” makes clear that the sheep is lost and the good shepherd is obliged to go after it, find it and carry it back. Shepherds in Lebanon, and in the Holy Land have said that once a sheep knows that it is lost, it tries to hide under a bush or rock and begins quivering and bleating. The shepherd must locate it quickly lest it be heard and killed by a wild animal. On being found it is usually too traumatized to walk and must be carried back to the flock or to the village.</p><p>Sheep have a special problem. They have no defenses. Cats have teeth, claws and speed. Likewise, dogs have teeth and speed. Horses can kick, bite and run. Bears can claw, bite and crush. Deer can run. But sheep have no serious bite, neither have they claws, nor can they outrun any serious predator. They can butt heads with other sheep, but that ability will not protect them from a wolf or a bear. The sheep’s only security is the shepherd.</p><p>We are like sheep, beloved, that have a tendency to stray or wander. It seems to be in our nature. The picture here can be one of a lost sinner, or a Christian that has gotten away from God. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, is looking for any lost sheep. You may have wandered off and can’t find your way back. The Good Shepherd is looking for you to bring you back.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 21-25	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-21-25.png
432	2020-07-09 02:40:52	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Psalm 19 records that God has revealed Himself in two distinct ways. First, creation has revealed God. “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard” (Psalms 19:1-3). All of creation speaks of the power of God. The apostle Paul wrote that God has revealed Himself to everyone through creation (Rom. 1:17-20). In theology we call this General Revelation. Though God has revealed Himself through the wonder of creation, it is quite limiting. Creation reveals that there is a Creator, but it doesn’t reveal all of His characteristics and attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it is necessary that God reveal Himself in a fuller capacity beyond creation. The Psalmist writes, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb” (Psalms 19:7-10). God has revealed Himself through the Scriptures. It is through the Bible that we can know of God’s character, His justice, mercy, grace, and love. This is called Special Revelation in theology.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Psalmist refers to Scripture as: Law; Testimony; Statutes, Commandments; Fear; Judgments. The characteristics of Scripture are called: perfect; sure; right; pure; clean; true. Finally, he lists the effects of Scripture: converting the soul; making wise the simple; rejoicing the heart; enlightening the eyes; endures forever; produces righteousness.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To summarize, the Word of God is the most comprehensive revelation of God, that can enhance and transform the life of any person who believes.

We might think the word “fool” means a weakness in intellect. And while that might be true, the word “fool” in the Hebrew means moral perversity. Certainly it’s foolish to not believe in God, but living like there is no God is far worse.</p><p>A life that rejects God always lives as if there is no God. This isn’t just mental denial in the existence of God, this is a practical rejection. The psalmist says the unbeliever acts corruptly, does abominable works, and does no good. The primary characteristic of not believing in God is the choice to live a godless life. The fool rejects God with his intellect, and his behavior reflects that belief. His actions are corrupt, he does things that are contrary to godliness.</p><p>Some may argue that atheists and unbelievers can do some works worth labeling “good.” However, in the eyes of God, they are not good because their deeds are not done to glorify Him.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some self-proclaimed Christians whose actions undo their profession. They live as if the God they claim to believe in doesn’t exist. They never pray, never share the gospel, and attempt to live as close to the world as they possibly can. Jesus said, “This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me” (Matt. 15:8).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it’s imperative that we not scoff at the atheist’s lack of faith, while we live as if God doesn’t exist. Our lives should embody the God we profess to believe in with our actions and lifestyle.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalms 9-16	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Psalm-9-16.png
434	2020-07-03 23:08:36	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>The book of Psalms opens with what has been called the gates of the Psalms. Before you can understand the depth of the Psalms you must meet the requirements. These two requirements are one way or the other. Two paths are laid out before use as we approach the Psalms. We will either adhere to the counsel of the Word of God or we will listen to the counsel of the ungodly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers” (Ps. 1:1). The blessed man is one that walks not in the counsel of the wicked. To be separated from the world is to be blessed of God. The godly man is marked by what he doesn’t do. The places he doesn’t go; the books he doesn’t read; the entertainment he doesn’t watch; and the company he doesn’t keep. In other words, a blessed man is known for the things he avoids. For instance, he avoids things that are poisonous to his walk with God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“Blessed is the man who sits not in the seat of the scornful.” The ungodly man has his counsel; the sinner has his way; the scornful has his seat. Note the progression in evil- the ungodly, the sinner, the scornful. Then note the progression of backsliding &#8211; walking, standing, and sitting. As the company gets worse sin increases its hold.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The blessed man doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked or ungodly. That means he refuses secular philosophy, and the humanistic values of the world. He refuses the worldview that places man at the center of the universe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The righteous man doesn’t stand in the way of sinners. His personal behavior resists the lure of the crowd and neither participates in their carnal activities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The godly man doesn’t sit in the seat of the scornful or mockers. He refuses to associate with those who mock God and His ways. He avoids relationships with those who reject God’s Word.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The godly man has a different counselor than the ungodly man, he finds different company than that of the wicked, sinful and scornful. His delight is in the Word of God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, let us forsake the ways of the ungodly and cling to path of the righteous.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Psalm 1-8	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-job-40-42-1.png
435	2020-07-02 22:38:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Lord spoke to Job from the whirlwind. Once He had finished speaking, Job said, “I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not” (Job 42:3). Job repented for the foolish things he had said. But the Lord wasn’t done speaking. For He took Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar to the woodshed: “for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right” (Job 42:7-8). They were commanded to offer sacrifices for their unwise counsel.</p><p>Four times God called Job “my servant.” Job was God’s servant before he suffered, while he suffered, and after he suffered (Job 1:8; 2:3, 42:7-9). It takes a special type of person to stay faithful to the Lord during the seasons of blessing and peace. But it takes an extraordinary type of person to endure suffering and still walk with God. That’s why the Lord could boldly declare Job as His servant.</p><p>The story of Job is remarkable. What makes it even more marvelous is the ending. The Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends (Job 42:10). The miserable comforters who had the audacity to think that Job was some miscreant deserving of punishment now had to rely on his prayers! Job praying for his friends despite how they spoke of him is another admirable trait of God’s servant.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it would do us all some good to frequently read through Job’s story to remind ourselves what it looks like to truly be a servant of God. For he was blessed, he suffered terribly, he was mistreated, he repented, prayed for his accusers, and was doubly blessed at the conclusion. Life as God’s servant may not be easy, but it’s certainly worth it in the end.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 40-42	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-job-40-42-1-1.png

Elihu, Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar and Job all had their time to say something. But until the Lord spoke, it was all for nought. The Lord asked, “Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge” (Job 38:2)?</p><p>People like to analyze and talk. They offer their opinions and proudly proclaim their point of view. Social media has given everyone a platform with the ability to voice their opinions. It’s not that people didn’t have opinions, and didn’t share them before. It just wasn’t broadcasted for all the world to see and hear. It doesn’t matter how uneducated, brilliant, ignorant, enlightening, or foolish it might be, people are sharing their opinions. The writer of Proverbs said, “Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him” (Prov. 29:20 ESV).</p><p>God was going to have the final say in Job’s life. And one of these days, He is going to have the final say for all of history. All opinions, point of views, and theories will be silenced and Almighty God will speak from the whirlwind of judgement.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 38-39	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-38-39.png

Here was a man who felt as if God had forsaken him. It seemed as if Job was going through his sufferings without the assistance of the Lord. But God had kept his eyes upon Job through the traumatic events that had overtaken him.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Through the course of a pandemic, job losses, economic distress, and social upheaval it may seem as if God is far away.

438	2020-06-30 02:18:49	\N	\N	\N	<p>Another friend of Job chimed in on Job’s plight. Elihu took a different approach than Job’s three other friends. Elihu wasn’t concerned with the possibility of Job’s past sins. Rather, he was concerned with Job’s present attitude. Elihu made a striking statement in his assessment of Job’s conversation with his three friends. Elihu said, “But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding” (Job 32:8).</p><p>The Lord formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). God endowed humanity with spirit. Additionally, from the breath of God came the Scriptures: “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16 ESV).</p><p>The Bible is God’s infallible Word. Scripture is infallible in that the original manuscripts contain no errors. “The law of the Lord is perfect” (Ps. 19:7). Scripture is infallible because its Author is infallible. Scribes and copiers have made mistakes in transcribing the Scriptures, but that does not negate the infallibility of Scripture.</p><p>The Bible is not only infallible it is also inerrant. “Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him” (Pro. 30:5). God, who is true, has given us His Word that is true. We can trust in the truthfulness of Scripture because the Author is trustworthy (Isa. 65:16, Jer. 10:10, John 3:33, 17:3, 1 John 5:20). Jesus boldly declared, “thy word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><p>Therefore, Scripture is the God-breathed written Word, which was penned by human men who were moved upon and inspired by the Spirit of God. Furthermore, the Word of God is Jesus Christ who was manifested in flesh to reveal God the Father, and to redeem sinful humanity from the eternal consequences of sin (John 1:1-2,14). Our very lives depend and live upon this written Word of God (Matt. 4:4). The Word of God is the written form of words that has been given to reveal God’s character, intent, and revelation. It is through the written Word that we can know God’s plan for redemption.</p><p>Beloved, God is the source of our physical life, and He has inspired the Word of God to give us spiritual life.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 32-34	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-32-341.png
439	2020-06-27 16:09:15	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Job was a man of faith and integrity. He turned away from evil, even the potential evil within himself. Job said, “I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid” (Job 31:1)? The word “covenant” in the Hebrew means to make an agreement or contract. In the Old Testament a covenant was made between two parties, which was a binding oath, such as the covenants God initiated with Noah and Abraham (Gen. 6:18; 14:13). For Job, this covenant was between himself and his eyes. Like any other man, the eyes are like wandering sheep without a shepherd. If the eyes aren’t disciplined and guided from evil then they will inevitably stray towards danger.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus warned, “But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>(Matthew 5:28). Jesus knew that the eye was the gateway to the heart. The apostle James added, “Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death” (James 1:15). What the eye looks upon could lead to lust within the heart. Certainly sin in the heart is not as devastating as actually committing sin. But unless the sinful desires of the heart and imagination are crucified, what’s in the heart will manifest itself into actions. For example, Jesus said, “Are ye also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies” (Matt. 15:16-19). The seeds of adultery are sown with a lustful eye, and that’s why Job made a covenant with his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Though we wouldn’t agree with his theology, the ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu wrote, “Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brothers, to have a life of integrity we must be watchful of our inner life, just as we are about our outward life. Guard your heart by beginning to make a covenant with your eyes.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 29-31	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-job-24-28-2.png
440	2020-06-27 02:12:32	\N	\N	\N	<p>Job’s friends could ask good questions, but they had wrong answers. Furthermore, they could speak insightfully about God, and yet they knew nothing about Him. That should give us great caution.</p><p>Bildad asked a good question, “How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman” (Job 25:4). Before he asked this question he was keenly aware of God’s righteousness: “Dominion and fear are with him, He maketh peace in his high places” (Job 25:2). God reigns supreme. His holiness and purity are brighter than the moon and stars. According to Bildad man is but a worm in the sight of God. The apostle Paul would agree with Bildad. Paul said, &#8220;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3:10).</p><p>Paul is emphatic in the first three chapters of Romans that all of humanity is under the power of sin. The Mosaic Law is unable to free humanity from sin’s grip. It is only through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ that humanity can experience spiritual freedom. Paul puts all of humanity under the umbrella of his theology of sin. Jews believed they were righteous due to being God’s chosen people and for their attempts of keeping the Mosaic Law.</p><p>Due to humanity’s lack of righteousness, and their ungodliness, God’s wrath is being revealed (Rom. 1:17-18). But what does Paul mean by God’s wrath? Sinners are condemned to an eternity without God and cannot inherit the Kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21).</p><p>Humanity is in need of salvation from sin, death and God’s wrath. Nothing within humanity has the ability to save (Rom. 7:18). It is only through the obedience of Jesus Christ in his life, death and resurrection that humanity can experience justification. The question is then: how is God’s righteousness imputed into sinful humanity? Is it by works of the Law? Not according to Paul.</p><p>Paul argues that justification and righteousness are obtained by faith, “What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith” (Rom. 9:30). Justification and righteousness are not obtained by works of the Law. The only way for one to be saved is through Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:21-26; 5:1-21). One can be justified by faith and have the righteousness of Christ imputed to them only by faith.</p><p>Yes, we are but filthy worms before a Holy God.

441	2020-06-25 21:37:35	\N	\N	\N	<p>I’m directionally challenged. I don’t know how I ever got around without a GPS. It’s a miracle that I ever got to my intended destinations before we had Global Positioning Systems on our smart phones. Have you ever felt lost? Not the kind of lost that is corrected with a GPS or a map. I mean lost. The cobwebs in your head kind of lost. The not sure if you’re coming or going kind of lost. You don’t know what to do kind of lost. We’ve all been there. And if you haven’t, well your day is coming!</p><p>Job knew that lost feeling. He said, “I go east, but he is not there. I go west, but I cannot find him. I do not see him in the north, for he is hidden. I look to the south, but he is concealed.” (Job 23:8-9 NLT). Job was in the midst of a crisis and he just needed a little direction. The problem was that he couldn’t seem to locate God. He couldn’t find Him in the east. He wasn’t to be found in the west. He was hidden in the north, and in the south He was concealed. At least that’s what it seemed like to Job. But when you’re lost it seems like you can’t locate God.</p><p>But Job found comfort: “But He knoweth the way that I take: When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold” (Job 23:10). Job didn’t know where God was, but God knew where Job was! Job wasn’t lost, he was exactly where God wanted him. Job realized that this was a test, and if he just stayed on course then he would come forth as gold.</p><p>How did Job know that God knew his location? “For I have stayed on God’s paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside” (Job 23:11 NLT). Job had stayed on God’s path though he was suffering and felt lost. The way that you stay on God’s path is continuing in God’s word: “I have not departed from his commands, but have treasured his words more than daily food” (Job 23:12).</p><p>Beloved, God knows where you are. It may seem as if God is silent, but He’s there with you. The best way for you to stay on God’s path during the test, is to pay attention to the roadmap He has given you, and that is the Word of God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 21-23	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-21-23.png

Furthermore, his wife had told him to curse God and die, and three of his friends had accused him of being a rank sinner.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A lesser man might throw his hands in the air and forsake his faith. But that’s not what Job did. In fact he said, “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Job 19:25-26). Job had lost much, but he didn’t lose his faith.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The word “redeemer” in the Hebrew means to “deliver” or to “buy back.” In other words, it is someone who purchases an object that has been previously sold. The usage of “redeemer” in the Old Testament refers to one who rescues another (Lev. 25:26; Ruth 4:6). For Job, God was still his Redeemer. Whether it was going to happen sooner or later, God was going to deliver Job from his suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Job added, “and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” Job may not have known it, but he was speaking prophetically. One of these days Jesus Christ will stand upon the earth and redeem all of His people. The apostle Paul said, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

443	2020-06-23 13:45:37	\N	\N	\N	<p>I recently read a book entitled The Secret Life of Trees. The most astonishing thing about trees is how social they are. Trees in a forest care for each other, sometimes even going so far as to nourish the stump of a felled tree for centuries after it was cut down by feeding it sugars and other nutrients, and so keeping it alive.</p><p>The author writes that trees help each other through fungi. A tree’s most important means of staying connected to other trees is a “wood wide web” of soil fungi that connects vegetation in an intimate network that allows the sharing of an enormous amount of information and goods.</p><p>The reason trees share food and communicate is that they need each other. It takes a forest to create a microclimate suitable for tree growth and sustenance. So it’s not surprising that isolated trees have far shorter lives than those living connected together in forests.</p><p>Part of Job’s reply to Zophar included an astonishing metaphor for life. Job said, “For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground; Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And bring forth boughs like a plant” (Job 14:7–9).</p><p>Beneath the surface the roots of a tree are reaching out for a life source. The beauty of a large trunk, spanning branches, and gorgeous green leaves might be destroyed, but hidden in the earth are roots trying to bring life again.</p><p>To Job it seemed as if his life was just a tree stump. Death, loss, and disease had wreaked havoc upon his life. You might be thinking the same thing. Life and bad decisions have left nothing but a tree stump. Underneath the surface of the stump, however, is a system reaching for water. If you’ll stay connected to the Body of Christ. If you’ll keep reaching towards where life is, then you will sprout again! You may have fallen, but you can get back up again (Micah 7:8). All you need is scent of water, just a sniff of life to bud again!</p><p>Beloved, if there is hope for a tree, then there is hope for you and me.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 14-16	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-14-16.png
470	2020-05-21 18:05:08	\N	\N	\N	<p>“And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods” (2 Chr. 2:5). That was Solomon’s pronouncement as the building of the Temple commenced. David left Solomon the plans and the material to erect this great house. This wasn’t going to be a monument built as a memorial for David. On the contrary, this was a house built to the Name of the Lord God! The Temple would a place for sacrifices, prayer, and worship.</p><p>As we read 2 Chronicles 1-5, we should note that the Temple wasn’t just built by the Israelites, though it was intended for their worship. David, before his death, had prepared priests, and organized skillful people to complete the project. Huram, the king of Tyre, and many Gentiles had a part of the Temple project (2 Chr. 2:17-18). These were not slaves, and they were not treated as such. Rather, they co-labored with the Israelites to build a great house for their great God! Though there were great differences between the Israelites and Gentiles, Solomon, David’s son, brought them together for the building of the Temple.</p><p>God has built Himself a great house. Though the Jews of the Old and New Testaments did not foresee or fully understand it, but God was building a house with both Jews and Gentiles. Jesus Christ, The Son of David, broke down the wall of division between Jews and Gentiles (Eph. 2:14)! God reconciled the differences between Jews and Gentiles, that He may have one unified church. The apostle Paul speaking to Gentile believers wrote, “Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself, being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit (Eph. 2:19-22).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 1-5	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-1-5.png
444	2020-06-23 03:14:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>Job’s friend, Zophar, was more assertive than Eliphaz and Bildad, for they presented their arguments with a little more courtesy. Zophar, on the other hand, seems a little aggravated with Job’s counter arguments thus far. “Shouldn’t someone answer this torrent of words? Is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking? Should I remain silent while you babble on? When you mock God, shouldn’t someone make you ashamed” (Job 11:2–3 NLT)?</p><p>Like Eliphaz and Bildad, Zophar believes Job is suffering due to his sin. “Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves” (Job 11:6 ESV). Despite Zophar’s flawed understanding of retribution, he made a jarring observation. Job, and all of humanity, do not get what they deserve. Obviously, he believes that Job is not suffering enough, but this is true of all sinful humanity.</p><p>Nobody gets what they truly deserve. Adam and Eve lived this reality. The Lord said they would die the day they ate of the forbidden tree (Gen. 2:17). Though they disobeyed God, they did not die at that moment. An innocent animal took their place, so they could live (Gen. 3:1-24).</p><p>God is not fair. Sinners don’t get what they deserve. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). In spite of our sin we receive grace. The greatest of all atrocities was that an innocent man died for the sin of the world. For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ (2 Cor. 5:21).</p><p>Beloved, we should be thankful that we’ve not received what we deserve. Instead of condemnation we have received salvation.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 11-13	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-11-13.png
445	2020-06-21 20:35:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>Job chapter nine is Job’s response to Bildad. Bildad is one of Job’s three friends who nothing more than miserable comforters (Job 16:2). Bildad believes that Job should repent, and that his suffering is due to Job’s sins. He even believes that Job’s children’s sins brought them God’s judgment (Job 8:4). But if you read the opening of Job you will see that Job would daily repent for his children’s actions if they perchance had sinned (Job 1:5).</p><p>Job responds to Bildad’s claims asking, “I know it is so of a truth: But how should man be just with God? If he will contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand” (Job 9:2–3). Job knows how great and powerful God is. On the other hand, Job considers himself to be weak and lowly.</p><p>God is holy, and humanity is impure. Sin defiles and soils. The Hebrew definition for “sin” is to “miss the mark” or “fall short.” Paul wrote, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23). What mark do we miss? We miss the mark of God’s character. On the other hand, sin is deeper than missing the mark. Sin stains (Jam. 1:27). Sin is considered idolatry (Col. 3:5). Sin separates us from God (Isa. 59:2). Finally, sin leads to death (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23; Jam. 1:15).</p><p>God is Holy and without sin. God’s holiness and perfection, and our sin keeps us separated. Job said, “For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, And we should come together in judgment. Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both” (Job 9:32-33).</p><p>What Job needed was a daysman. The word “daysman” means to be an arbitrator. The meaning is that of someone to reconcile our differences, the laying on of whose hand expresses power to judge between the two persons.</p><p>Job can’t cleanse himself from the stain of sin. Job didn’t have anyone in the heavens who could relate to his suffering and plight. Job could not find the words to sufficiently plead his cause. What Job needed was a daysman who could represent both sides.</p><p>Job is not God, and God is not a man. If only God were to become a man that He might understand Job’s condition. Not just Job’s only, but all of humanity. Job is not the only to feel unclean from sin. All of sinful humanity needs someone who can cleanse us from the defilement of sin.</p><p>Beloved, there is good news for you! But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. The apostle Paul added, “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). Only Jesus Christ could be the daysman. Because only Jesus has the qualities necessary to answer both God’s demands, and the human need. As a man, He represents our needs to a holy God. As God, He represents God’s holiness to sinful humanity.</p><p>Job, here is your daysman!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 8-10	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-8-10.png
446	2020-06-20 22:20:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>Job chapter two introduces us to Job’s friends, who play an integral part of the book. “Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him” (Job 2:11). When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief. Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words.</p><p>Each of these three men had a different perspective for Job’s suffering. The interactions between them and Job are enlightening to say the least.</p><p>Eliphaz the Temanite was the first to offer Job some insight. Eliphaz was a descendant of Teman (Gen. 36:11). Bible commentators note that Teman was renown for its wisdom. At a glance much of what Eliphaz says sounds wise and insightful. He bases most of his observations on a strange encounter he had. Eliphaz said, “This truth was given to me in secret, as though whispered in my ear. It came to me in a disturbing vision at night, when people are in a deep sleep. Fear gripped me, and my bones trembled. A spirit swept past my face, and my hair stood on end. The spirit stopped, but I couldn’t see its shape. There was a form before my eyes. In the silence I heard a voice say, ‘Can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone be pure before the Creator.’”</p><p>This forms the basis of Eliphaz’s arguments that will continue the rest of the book. In essence, Eliphaz believes that Job’s suffering is due to sin. “Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty” (Job 5:17). According to the Temanite, Job is a sinner and God is delivering the judgment.</p><p>On the surface Eliphaz’s arguments hold a tinge of truth. God is angry with the wicked (Ps. 7:10-12). Most assuredly God does chasten His children for disobedience (Heb. 12:6). In Job’s case, however, God had already declared that Job was one who walked uprightly and hated evil (Job 1:8).</p><p>Eliphaz holds to a very rigid form of the retribution principle, which says God punishes the wicked and blesses those who do good. That Job is suffering is evidence enough that Job is a sinner being punished.</p><p>Jesus said, “it rains on the just and the unjust.” Trials and tribulations are part of life. Job’s trial was not based on any wrongdoing. Rather, his trial was based on God’s trust that he was righteous. Like Eliphaz we get it wrong when we believe that someone’s suffering is due to some secret sin, or that God is angry with them. Someone may be going through a difficult season simply because God trusts them to hold fast their faith and integrity.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 5-7	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-5-7.png
447	2020-06-18 16:34:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Book of Job is one of the most interesting books in the Bible. Job’s life and experiences have provided hope and healing for many of God’s people. Some on the other hand view Job’s life and story as only a fanciful story not to be taken as reality. However, Scripture views Job and his story as history and not make believe.</p><p>The author of Job presents Job as an actual person living in an actual place (1:1). According to the author Jehovah considered Job to be an actual person (1:8). Ezekiel refers to Job alongside Noah, and Daniel, whom both were actual persons (Ez. 14:14, 20). In the New Testament, James refers to Job’s endurance (Jam. 5:11). It should also be noted that Paul quotes from Job in Romans 11:35 and 1 Corinthians 3:19.</p><p>Some think of the book of Job as only about suffering and endurance. And while that may be true, it is only part of the story. We mustn’t overlook the cosmic battle between good and evil that opens the story (Job 1:8-11; 2:3).</p><p>The sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them (Job 1:6). Job didn’t know it but he had found himself in the midst of God and Satan. From that moment Job is tested. Satan takes Job’s property and children. As if that wasn’t enough the next time Satan presented himself before the Lord he wanted another chance to see if Job would hold to his integrity. The Lord allowed Satan to strike Job with awful sores from his head to feet (Job 2:1-8).</p><p>What I have found intriguing is God’s perspective of Job. God says twice that there is none like Job in the earth and that he is blameless and upright, and that he fears God and turns away from evil. Job’s character is of the upmost importance to the story of Job. Job never knows why he suffered the way he did. You will not find the explanation given to him.</p><p>Suffering is evidence that something is terribly wrong with the world. As a pastor I have had to counsel and console those who are suffering. the Book of Job is the most thorough treatment of suffering in the Bible . Perhaps the most important thing to remember when using the Book of Job for counseling people, or ourselves, is that we, unlike Job, know some of the reasoning of his suffering, despite the fact that Job never knew why he suffered. As we counsel people we do not have such an advantage as to the reasoning behind their agony. We must not try to answer the why of their suffering, rather we offer a response to suffering.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Job 1-4	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Job-1-4.png
448	2020-06-17 20:35:27	\N	\N	\N	<p>Haman approached King Xerxes and said, “There is a certain race of people scattered through all the provinces of your empire who keep themselves separate from everyone else. Their laws are different from those of any other people, and they refuse to obey the laws of the king. So it is not in the king’s interest to let them live. If it please the king, issue a decree that they be destroyed, and I will give 10,000 large sacks of silver to the government administrators to be deposited in the royal treasury.” Haman deceptively persuaded the king to destroy the Jews. Xerxes was ignorant of the fact that his new queen, Esther, was a Jew too. Haman wasn’t privy to this information either.</p><p>Mordecai made contact with Esther and told her of Haman’s evil plan. In order to expose Haman’s evil scheme, and to reveal her secret to the king without being killed, Esther called for all of the Jews to fast. For three days they would neither eat nor drink (Esther 4:16).</p><p>Jesus said, “Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward” (Matthew 6:16). Allow me to take my liberty and say that fasting is a command and not just a suggestion. Jesus didn’t say, “If you decide to fast,” but He clearly says, “when ye fast.” I believe that fasting is a command that is just as important as His command for us to pray.</p><p>In Matthew’s gospel there is an account given about a young boy with a devil. Jesus was in the mountain with Peter, James and John being transfigured before their eyes. Yet, at the foot of the mountain the remaining disciples are trying to deal with boy and the devil, which has taken possession of his body. As Jesus approaches the situation the father cries out for help, because the disciples have been rendered powerless over this devil. They cannot seem to cure this boy of his spiritual affliction.</p><p>The disciples asked why they couldn’t successfully cast the devil out. Jesus replied, “Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting” (Matt. 17:21). Like Esther and the Jews, there are some spirits that can only be overcome with prayer and fasting. It is my opinion that there are certain temptations, habits and vices that believers have little power over without the discipline of fasting operating in their life.</p><p>Esther was able to find favor with the king, thwart Haman’s evil plot, and bring victory to all of the Jews, because she knew the power of prayer and fasting.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Esther 6-10	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Esther-6-10.png
449	2020-06-17 02:12:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>Though the book of Esther is only ten chapters in length, it’s teeming with significance and importance. The events of the book took place during the reign of Xerxes (also called Ahasuerus), king of Persia. The timeline of these events place it between Zerubbabel rebuilding the Temple, and the arrival of Ezra. While there was a remnant of Jews who returned to Jerusalem, the book of Esther is concerned with the remainder of Jews who stayed in Persia (formerly Babylon) and the surrounding regions.</p><p>King Xerxes decided to throw a party and invited all of his nobles, officials and the military officers, and leaders of many of his provinces. The party lasted for 180 days! The king wanted his wife, queen Vashti, to come to the banquet so that the nobles and all the other men could gaze upon her beauty. The queen, however, refused to come. This made the king furious (Esther 1:11-12). All of the men feared that Vashti’s actions would inspire women everywhere to revolt against their husbands (1:18). Therefore, Xerxes banished Vashti from the kingdom, which led the king to begin a search for a replacement queen.</p><p>We should pause at this moment in the story. So far nothing seems extraordinary about this event. People have been doing dumb stuff for all of history. What does this have to do with God and with His people? You may even notice that God is never mentioned in the book either. Though He isn’t mentioned by Name or action, He plays a major role in this amazing story.</p><p>Life can certainly be like that. Things can begin to look mundane and insignificant, then all of a sudden you get invited to the king’s palace to be a candidate for his new queen. That’s what happened to Esther (2:7-8). Up until this point she had been raised by her older cousin, Mordecai. Unbeknownst to them they had just been invited to God’s divine plan to save His people from destruction. For there was an evil man by the name of Haman who wanted to destroy the Jews.</p><p>All of this began when an important person refused an invitation to a party. Beloved, God is in control of the seemingly insignificant events of history. And we never know when we may get invited to be a participant in His plans. Let us not refuse, for we may have been brought to the Kingdom for such a time as this (Esther 4:14).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Esther 1-5	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Esther-1-5.png

451	2020-06-14 10:56:38	\N	\N	\N	<p>After the walls had been built and there had been some improvement with Israel’s spirituality, Nehemiah noticed something very strange: “And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people” (Neh. 13:24).</p><p>The people of Israel had married themselves to foreign peoples such as Ashdod, Ammonites, and Moabites. The Israelites were not to marry or mix with heathen people. But that wasn’t the only problem. Nehemiah noticed a change in the language.</p><p>Nehemiah observed the language change in the speech of the children. What caught Nehemiah’s attention was that the children were not able to speak the language of Judah. They couldn’t speak the Hebrew language, instead they spoke the languages of Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. The people of Ashdod were a mongrel people. The Ammonites and Moabites worshiped Molech and Chemosh who worshiped their respective gods by sacrificing their children in fire. Ammon and Moab were the incestuous offspring of Lot and his daughters.</p><p>There is more than just nationalistic pride at stake with Nehemiah and Israel. What’s at stake is the Scripture. Holy Scripture is in the language of Judah, which was written in Hebrew. They needed to speak the Hebrew language in order to read and obey the Scripture. If the children couldn’t speak Hebrew, then they certainly wouldn’t be able to read and understand the Law and Prophets. Likewise, the Israelites were to be separate. But the compromise of their separation was identified by their speech. What they spoke was an indicator of their lack of separation.</p><p>The Israelite’s identity was vanishing and the main indicator was the type of language the children were speaking. Young people, you do not need to speak the language of the world. We have too many Christian students who can speak the language of Xbox, Fortnite, Snapchat, Instagram, and the gods of entertainment. However, they can’t speak the language of Scripture. Doctrine has been left to adults and preachers.</p><p>Beloved, let us keep speaking and transmitting the language of Pentecost and the Apostolic doctrine. We should teach our children the Scriptures. We should be consistently sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with the world. The church cannot afford to be satisfied with our “four and no more.” The Apostolic church is a movement, not a memorial. Our churches are not to be a museum of what used to be, rather it should be a shining example and extension of what began on the day of Pentecost. The tombstones of some Christian denominations should be a grave reminder that compromise and forgetfulness are deadly. The Apostolic church has a responsibility to stay on the old paths, but those old paths need new feet.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 12-13	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Nehemiah-12-13.png
452	2020-06-13 21:59:26	\N	\N	\N	<p>Once the people heard Ezra and the Levites expound the Word of God, they repented of their sins, and prepared themselves to enter into covenant with God (Neh. 9:38). This was a serious matter. The people had just heard the history of their ancestors how they were constantly rebellious and disobedient (Neh. 9:26-28). Would they be like their forefathers and be unfaithful to the Lord? Or would they be faithful to the Lord as He had been faithful to them throughout their history?</p><p>“They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons” (Neh. 10:29-30). In essence, the people were devoting their lives unto the Lord. In order to do so, they would separate themselves from all the nations around them, which was the stumbling block of previous generations.</p><p>Repentance is more than just asking forgiveness. It’s about changing your ways. John the Baptist said, “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance” (Matt. 3:8). The fruit of repentance is forsaking your sin and former way of living. You can’t turn to God without turning from something else. Beloved, when you turn to Jesus Christ you have to turn away from sin and the world.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 10-11	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Nehemiah-10-11.png
453	2020-06-12 02:51:23	\N	\N	\N	<p>Zerubbabel successfully rebuilt the Temple. Ezra reestablished worship. Nehemiah accomplished the extensive task of reconstructing Jerusalem’s walls. The next undertaking for Ezra and Nehemiah was to rebuild the people. The Temple, the worship, and the walls were meaningless if Jerusalem’s inhabitants remained broken. The Judeans were taken into Babylonian captivity due to their perpetual backsliding. It didn’t matter how beautiful the Temple was, how organized the sacrifices were, or how fortified the walls were if the people were less than whole.</p><p>“And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel” (Neh. 8:1). How do you build broken people? With the Word of God. Nehemiah gathered all of the people together and had Ezra read from the Law of Moses. Ezra stood upon a pulpit made of wood, opened the Word of God and began to read aloud to the people.</p><p>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15). Every Christian can know the Bible. It is God’s desire for every believer to know and understand the Word of God. Christians should not be handicapped in their ability to read and study the Bible. To know truth, attain joy, have victory and, grow spiritually you must be able to read, study and understand the Bible.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 8-9	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Nehemiah-8-9.png
454	2020-06-11 02:32:40	\N	\N	\N	<p>The rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls only took fifty-two days to complete (Neh. 6:15). Nehemiah could have sat back and relaxed after accomplishing such an amazing task. However, that’s not what happened. “And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God” (Neh. 6:16). Despite the walls being rebuilt, there were still enemies looming. There was no time for rest. Therefore, Nehemiah began his next project &#8211; protecting the city and its inhabitants.</p><p>Nehemiah set up doors on the gates, and appointed gatekeepers (Neh. 7:1). Among the gatekeepers were Levites and musicians. He also placed his brother, Hanani, and a man named Hananiah in charge of overseeing the city’s protection. The gatekeepers and the watchmen were to keep watch at all times. Failure to keep watch would make the city susceptible to the enemy.</p><p>There will always be outside forces who attempt to infiltrate churches, youth groups, ministry teams, and families. False Christians, false teachers, and false doctrines will always be enemies of the true church. The wall wasn’t enough for Jerusalem, and it won’t be enough for the church. God has set in place watchmen on the walls for the church. The watchman was to sound the alarm when an enemy was approaching. The role of pastors and spiritual leaders is to sound the alarm at the sight of imminent danger. Preaching that warns and cautions shouldn’t be avoided, and it shouldn’t be shunned. It might just be what keeps a Christian safe, or a child from backsliding.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should be thankful for the gatekeepers, pastors, and preachers who have kept us safe throughout our Christian experience.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 7	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Nehemiah-7.png
455	2020-06-09 02:19:25	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Nehemiah’s task of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem was intimidating. Some estimate the city’s circumference at that time was between one and half to two and miles. Not only were the walls in ruins, but the myriad of city gates were desolate too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, Nehemiah didn’t have to work alone. The people of Jerusalem, leaders and laymen, immediately got to work. Keep in mind that the people neither built nor bought new block for the walls. They had to repair the broken down and charred block as they rebuilt. Isn’t that the way life goes? Ruin, repair, and rebuild. The broken pieces of your life can be used to restore what was once torn down. Restoration begins when we, like Nehemiah, weep over the ruins. There can be no restoration until there is repentance. Once repentance has taken place, the next phase of restoration can begin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only was Nehemiah’s task nearly impossible, but he had to deal with ridicule. Sanballat, the Samaritan governor, and Tobiah, an Ammonite official, mocked and ridiculed the rebuilding project. Sanballat said, “What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned” (Nehemiah 4:2)? Restoration will always be met with ridicule. People love to see good people fall, but they don’t always enjoy their comeback. Some would rather people be left in the ruins of past mistakes than see them attempt to recover or rebuild. Likewise, the devil would like nothing more than for people to remain in their sinful and desolate condition than to be restored.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Sanballat asked the question, “Can they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish?” Beloved, can Jesus revive a life from the heaps of failures and sin? Absolutely, He can! But like the broken down walls of Jerusalem, it took a community to rebuild it. The apostle Paul wrote, “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted” (Gal. 6:1). Jesus can forgive and heal a person, but it is necessary that the Church come together to restore that individual as well. Someone has said that it takes a village to a raise a child. Just the same, it takes the church to rebuild a life.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 4-6	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-ezra-7-10-3.png
456	2020-06-07 22:15:01	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Thirteen years had passed since Ezra’s return to Jerusalem. Though Zerubbabel had rebuilt the Temple and there had been some reform under Ezra’s spiritual leadership, the city remained destitute. A remnant of Jews remained in Persia (formerly Babylon). Of those that remained was Nehemiah, a cupbearer for king Artaxerxes. One of Nehemiah’s brothers returned to Persia with bad news after visiting Jerusalem: “The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire“ (Neh. 1:3). Jerusalem was a broken city with broken people. Despite Zerubbabel and Ezra’s efforts, God’s people were defiling themselves again by intermarrying with heathens (Ezra 9-10).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The news broke Nehemiah’s heart. He immediately began a fast and went to prayer. On behalf of Israel and himself he began to repent (Neh. 1:4-11). Nehemiah may have been afraid that the Jew’s return to both Jerusalem and to their former sins may lead God to break covenant with them (Neh. 1:8-9). Here was a man who had a burden for God’s holiness, and for His people.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It came to pass that the Persian king noticed Nehemiah’s visibly sad countenance (Neh. 2:1-2). Nehemiah confessed his sadness of heart was due to the shape of Jerusalem. Artaxerxes asked, “What are you requesting?” Nehemiah quickly prayed within himself and asked: “And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers&#8217; sepulchres, that I may build it”(Neh. 2:5). The king gave Nehemiah permission, and gave him official letters to show the governors of the surrounding Persian provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When Nehemiah arrived at Jerusalem he took time to survey the city. He came to the leaders of Jerusalem and said, “Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach” (Neh. 2:17).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nehemiah didn’t come to rebuild the Temple, Zerubbabel took care of that. Nehemiah didn’t come to teach the Law to the city’s inhabitants, Ezra had been trying to reform the people. Nehemiah came to build the walls. Because what good is spiritual reformation without worldly separation? The Jews needed to be devoted to the Lord, and separated from the world. And to that the people said, “Let us rise up and build!”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, right worship must be met with right living. The remnant of Jews in Jerusalem needed to be protected from outward enemies who sought to thwart their devotion to holiness. Likewise, the Christian believer must have the same mindset. We are to live in the world, not allow the world to live in us. To be God’s people means to be people of devotion and separation (2 Cor. 6:17).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Nehemiah 1-3	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-ezra-7-10-1.png
457	2020-06-06 21:41:16	\N	\N	\N	<p>Eighty years after Zerubbabel had led the first remnant of Jews to Jerusalem, Ezra led an additional 1,500 Jewish men and their families to Jerusalem. Ezra was the son of a priest born in Babylon. Not only was Ezra a priest, but he was also a scribe. A scribe, such as Ezra, studied and taught the Law of Moses. Ezra could function as both a priest and a teacher. He could offer sacrifices at the Temple, but he could also read, interpret and teach the Law. Ezra pictures the Lord Jesus Christ as both priest and teacher.</p><p>“This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him” (Ezra 7:6). Ezra is described as a “ready scribe.” The word “ready” in the Hebrew means to be skilled or diligent. This same concept is found in Paul’s letter to Timothy: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). Believers are to be skilled in the Word of God. We study the Bible with the aim to always be ready to give an answer for the hope that is within us (1 Pt. 3:15).</p><p>It’s one thing to have the Bible in your head, but it’s another thing altogether to have it in your heart. “For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments” (Ezra 7:10). The apostle James wrote, “But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves” (James 1:22). Knowledge of the Bible should lead to obedience. Likewise, if we are to teach others then it is imperative that we live what we preach.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ezra 7-10	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ezra-7-10.png
458	2020-06-04 17:34:09	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Zerubbabel led the initial Jewish remnant from Babylon to Jerusalem. He was a descendent of David, being that he was the great-grandson of Jehoiakin (Jeconiah). In Ezra, Zerubbabel is also called by his Chaldean name “Sheshbazzar” (Ezra 1:8,11; 5:14-16), and the Persian title for governor “Tirshatha” (Ezra 2:63). His Hebrew name, Zerubbabel, means “descended from Babylon,” meaning that he was born while exiled in Babylon. This is more than likely the case, considering his great-grandfather became king of Judah at the age of eighteen, and was taken into Babylonian captivity just three months into his reign (2 Kings 24:8-17; 2 Chr. 36:9-10). Furthermore, in the New Testament, Matthew and Luke included Zerubbabel in the lineage of Jesus Christ (Matt. 1:12; Lk. 3:27).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In all likelihood, if he had been born in Babylon, the return to Jerusalem for Zerubbabel was actually the first time he had been to his homeland. This is what makes his Temple rebuilding mission quite extraordinary &#8211; he had never seen it! He had never worshiped there. He had never seen the priests carryout their priestly duties. Moreover, he had never seen the Jewish people live out their faith without some sort of Babylonian influence. Zerubbabel’s mission was more than just unfathomable, it was nearly impossible!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Zerubbabel, thankfully, had spiritual guidance during this nearly-impossible mission. The prophet Zechariah helped encourage Zerubbabel and offered him this prophetic word from the Lord: “This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ saith the Lord of hosts” (Zech. 4:6). Zerubbabel wasn’t going to complete these insurmountable tasks through his own strength and effort. On the contrary, the Spirit of the Lord would help Zerubbabel and Judah.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, God often times calls us to hard things. He calls some to go to foreign lands and preach the gospel where it has never been heard. He calls others to plant churches in urban or rural areas. He sends some to make disciples of prisoners behind bars. There are those who are called to make Christ known on secular college campuses. The same promise for Zerubbabel is the very same promise for you &#8211; it’s not possible by human might or power, but it is made possible through the Spirit of the Lord. The same Spirit that commissions is the same Spirit that empowers to fulfill the mission.</p>\r\n	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ezra 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ezra-4-6.png
459	2020-06-03 21:47:41	\N	\N	\N	<p>After seventy years of captivity in Babylon, a remnant of Jews were allowed to return to Jerusalem. Covering one hunderd years of history, the book is divided into two parts. The first part of the book chronicles twenty years of a remnant of Jews returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple under the leadership of Zerubbabel (Ezra 1-6). After a gap of sixty years, the second part of the book records an additional remnant of Jews returning, and the proceeding reformation under the leadership of Ezra (Ezra 7-10). We can conclude that the theme of Ezra’s book is returning, rebuilding and reforming.</p><p>Almost a century before the writings of Ezra the prophet Isaiah, and the prophet Jeremiah foretold of Judah’s captivity to Babylon as a form of judgment for their idolatry (Isa. 6:11-12; 11:11-12; 39:5-7; Jer. 20:4-6; 21:7-10). Jeremiah also prophesied that their captivity would only last 70 years. The Lord said, “For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end” (Jeremiah 29:10–11).</p><p>First, God is faithful to His Word. God has never failed to keep His promises (1 Kings 8:56). Heaven and earth shall pass away but God’s Word shall never pass away (Matt. 24:35). Much time had elapsed between Jeremiah’s prophecies, Judah’s captivity and eventual return. God is neither bound by space nor time. His Word will be fulfilled. Judah may have failed to keep their part of the covenant, but God remained faithful.</p><p>Second, God is in control. God used Nebuchadnezzar to take Judah into captivity and to punish them for their sins (Jer. 25:9; 27:6; 43:10). God also stirred up Cyrus to overthrow the Babylonians and to establish Persian rule. God used Gentile kings to do His bidding, and to fulfill His will.</p><p>Beloved, we can have assurance that God is faithful and in control. Time may pass, and circumstances may change, but God is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ezra 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Ezra-1-3.png
460	2020-06-02 13:42:22	\N	\N	\N	<p>Our reading through First Kings to Second Chronicles has been a roller coaster of emotions. We’ve read of the beauty of Solomon’s Temple being built. Followed by Solomon’s fall, and the division of the kingdom. There have been godly kings, and evil kings. Battles have been won and lost. Israel was taken captive by the Assyrians, and then Jerusalem and the Temple were destroyed as Judah was taken into captivity by the Babylonians.</p><p>History has shown that no nation or people can rise higher than their devotion to God. The Northern Kingdom never had leadership from a godly king, they were perpetually serving idols. The Southern Kingdom fluctuated between good and evil kings. They would have revival, then revert back to idolatry.</p><p>Despite the dark shadow of Judah being exiled and Jerusalem being destroyed, we have a glimmer of hope: “Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up” (2 Chr. 36:22–23).</p><p>The Persian king asked, “Who is there among you of all his people?” Who among the captives was willing to go back and rebuild the Temple? Who was willing to go back and establish true worship? The reason why Judah was taken into captivity was due to their unfaithfulness to the Lord. If they wanted to go back, however, it was going to be based upon the willingness to put the Lord first.</p><p>Restoration begins when we turn from our sinful ways and put the Lord first in our lives. Until we are willing to recognize the reason for our captivity, we will never discover the path to freedom.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 35-36	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-35-36.png
461	2020-06-01 07:00:00	\N	\N	\N	<p>Salt is produced from the combination of two of the most deadly chemicals known to man &#8211; sodium, an unstable metal, and chlorine, one of the deadliest gases. When these two deadly chemicals are combined they produce sodium chloride, also known as common table salt. Salt is the only known rock that humans consume.</p><p>Additionally salt is produced “from oceans and lakes which can be produced by letting shallow holes of water dry up in the sun. The salt which remains is coarse grained, not like our fine-grained table salt. Salt produced this way is called solar salt. Each gallon of water produces more than 1/4 pound of salt. Salt buried in mines deep in the earth, however, is the main source of our table salt. Salt mines are found almost everywhere in the world. The salt is obtained by two methods. In one, the salt veins in deep mines are broken loose by drills and explosives.”</p><p>The word “salt” comes from the Latin word “sal,” which means salt. Salt was once a valuable commodity, and was used as currency. The English word “salary” comes from the word the Latin word for salt. It has been said there are more than 14,000 uses for salt. Salt is used for flavoring and preserving food. It also used in tanning, dyeing, and producing soap, pottery, and chlorine. Salt is also used in melting icy roads, and for agricultural uses. Furthermore, salt purifies, heals, and preserves.</p><h1>The Covenant of Salt in Worship</h1><p>Salt was important in the Ancient Near East as well. The Lord included salt in the grain offerings of Israel:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire. As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering. And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord&#8221; (Leviticus 2:11–16).</p></blockquote><p>The grain offering appears always to have followed the burnt offering (Num. 28:1–8) and consisted of flour and oil. Though it too provided a “sweet smelling aroma,&#8221; its purpose wasn&#8217;t so much to secure atonement, but rather it was a gift of worship or devotion unto the Lord.</p><p>In the grain offering three things were to be included: frankincense, oil, and salt. However, two things were to be excluded from the grain offering: honey and leaven. The sacrifice didn&#8217;t need to be sweetened. No matter how much we may try, there is no way to sweetened the death of Jesus Christ. It was an awful event. Some would rather us leave out the message of the atoning work of Christ. But His blood had to be shed for the remission of our sins.</p><h2>Frankincense</h2><p>Frankincense was a brown-like substance that exuded from the Boswellia tree. It was used as a fragrance (Song of Solomon 3:6; 4:6,14). Throughout the Bible, however, it was used exclusively for sacrifices in worship and prayer. It was the only incense allowed at the altar with the grain offerings, and was included in the incense in the Tabernacle (Ex. 30:34). The purpose of frankincense was to provide a sweet smelling fragrance. Likewise, our prayer and worship should be flavored with frankincense. The Lord loves a cheerful giver, but he also loves a joyful worshiper. Worship shouldn’t be drudgery, it should be delight. Prayer shouldn’t be boring, but beautiful.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord” (Ps. 122:1).</p><p>“Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; And his truth endureth to all generations” (Psalm 100).</p></blockquote><h2>Oil</h2><p>The offering had to be accompanied with oil (Lev. 2:1–2, 4, 6, 15), either poured on it or mingled with it. This is a picture of the Holy Spirit, who was given to us without measure (John 3:34). Not only do we need some joy in our worship and prayers, we need the Holy Ghost to accompany it. When’s the last time the Holy Spirit accompanied your worship? When’s the last time the Holy Ghost assisted in your prayer time?</p><blockquote><p>“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost” (Jude 20).</p><p>“Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God” (Romans 8:26–27).</p></blockquote><h2>Salt</h2><p>The Lord didn’t ask for honey or sugar to be added, He insisted on salt. The addition of salt to the grain offering represented an everlasting relationship between God and His people.</p><p>Salt symbolized the life and enduring nature of the alliance. In the OT salt appears in the relationship between God and Israel (Lv 2:13). As a purifying agent and preservative in the grain offering, salt symbolized the everlasting nature of the covenant between God and Israel.</p><h1>The Covenant of Salt</h1><p>In the Ancient Near East salt was exchanged as a symbol when treaties or alliances were made. Salt signified that the relationship or agreement was perpetual. The use of the salt in the sacrifices was a reminder that God’s covenant with Israel indissoluble.</p><p>When God made a covenant with David, it was said, “The Lord gave the kingdom to David forever by a covenant of salt” (2 Chr. 13:5). The covenant between God and David was everlasting (2 Sam. 7). The importance of the inclusion of salt in the offerings, and the representation of salt in the covenant between God and David, symbolizes the everlasting covenant between Christ and the Church.</p><p>In light of the covenant of salt, the words of Jesus become significant: “Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another” (Mk. 9:50). To be salt in the world, Christians must be seasoned with salt, which only comes through being united with Jesus Christ in the everlasting covenant of salt. Salt represents permanence and incorruption.</p><p>The uses of salt in an offering symbolized an everlasting relationship between Christ and the Church—they everlastingly belong to Him, and He everlastingly belongs to them.</p><p>In essence the “Covenant of Salt” cemented the relationship between both parties.</p><h1>Salt Preserves</h1><p>Salt dries food to preserve it. Salt draws water out of food and dehydrates it. All living things require water and cannot grow in the absence of it, including bacteria which can cause food poisoning. Furthermore, salt kills microbes that lead to bacteria and toxins.</p><p>The world and its toxins could be destructive to the believer. If we stay in the Covenant of Salt with Jesus, then He will keep and preserve us!</p><blockquote><p>“The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth, and even for evermore” (Psalm 121:7–8).</p></blockquote><p>Another translation says:</p><blockquote><p>“The Lord keeps you from all harm and watches over your life. The Lord keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever” (Psalm 121:7–8 NLT).</p></blockquote><h1>Salt as Purifies</h1><p>Salt can be used as a purifying agent. For instance, the addition of salt may help to purify water. The prophet Elisha purified poisoned water by adding salt to it (2 Kings 2:19-22).</p><p>We should also note that salt impedes the growth of leaven. Paul said that a little leaven leavens the whole lump (Gal. 5:9). Leaven, as a type of sin, is dangerous. In the Old Testament, especially in the Passover, leaven represented the defilements of the world. Leaven was to be left out of the bread of the Passover. But the use the addition of salt can kill the leavening agent.</p><p>If we are to combat the rise of sin in our hearts, then we must be consistently salted with the Word of God, and devotion to the covenant we have with Him.</p><h1>Salt Heals</h1><p>Many of us remember being told by our parents to gargle warm water and salt to ease the pain of sore throats, mouth ulcers, or canker sores (as they are known by in the Whitley home). Conversely, the old saying &#8220;rubbing salt into the wound&#8221; suggests salt makes things worse and results in <span style="caret-color: rgb(54, 54, 54); color: rgb(54, 54, 54); font-family: AvenirLTStd-Medium; font-size: 24px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none">excruciating</span> pain. The medicinal use of salt water can be traced back to the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians, all of whom used it to treat cuts, wounds, mouth sores&nbsp;and skin irritations.</p><blockquote><p>“Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men” (Matthew 5:13).</p></blockquote><p>The point of this verse is the influence of believers in the world. The church is to be an agent for good in the world. If there is going to be healing in our world, then the church must be salty. The church must bring flavor to a rather bland and sinful world.</p><p>But salt can also be bitter. What the church stands for may run contrary to the world’s ideals. Our morality is different. Our lifestyle is different. Our values are different. But these things are what give the church its value. The One with whom we are in covenant with is different! His ways are higher than our ways. His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.</p><p>Salt can also sting. Salt in a wound may sting, but it may also cleanse and heal. The sting of sin is met with the balm of Jesus Christ. The church’s doctrine may sting the conscience, and make it uncomfortable. But the process of healing begins when the wound is diagnosed.</p><p>Jesus said salt could lose its savor. There is a sense that salt may never lose its saltiness, but it could become contaminated causing it to lose its flavor. Or salt may become watered down, causing it to lose its effectiveness. In other words, it is good for nothing, and needs to be cast out and trodden under foot.</p><p>Christians may lose their value and effectiveness in the world when sin and worldliness contaminate them. We cannot be an influence for purity if we have been contaminated.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><blockquote><p>“Now because we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king” (Ezra 4:14 KJV).</p><p>“Now because we share the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king’s dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king” (Ezra 4:14 NRSV).</p></blockquote><p>The Pulpit Commentary said, “The marginal rendering is better, and shows the true sense. ‘Eating a man&#8217;s salt’ in the East is deriving one&#8217;s subsistence from him. The man who eats another&#8217;s salt is bound to look after his interests. It was not meet for us to see the king&#8217;s dishonour. Rather, &#8220;the king&#8217;s detriment or loss&#8221; &#8211; it was not meet for us to stand by tamely and see the king stript of his due.”</p><p>In other words, we who are in the Covenant of Salt with Christ, share in His interests! The blessings of Jesus Christ are ours. We derive our subsistence from Him. He provides for us, and care for us. He preserves, purifies, and heals. Furthermore, we must honor Him with our lives. We honor Him with our worship, and devotion. We honor Him by not being ashamed of Him or His Gospel (Lk. 9:26, Rom. 1:16).</p>	100	\N	The Covenant of Salt	\N	/jason-tuinstra-4OfaTz6SdYs-unsplash-scaled.jpg
462	2020-05-31 23:39:00	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Manasseh became king of Judah at the age of twelve, and reigned for fifty-five years. He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. He built the high places, which Hezekiah his father had broken down. He erected altars for the purpose of worshiping Baalim, and made groves to worship the host of heaven. He even built altars for idols in the Temple. To make matters worse, he caused his children to pass through the fire. He sought the counsel of witches and wizards, used enchantments, and communicated with familiar spirits. Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the heathen nations. Needless to say, the Lord was provoked to anger with Manasseh (2 Chr. 33:1-9).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord sent prophets to Manasseh, but he refused to listen. So the Lord brought against Judah the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the story of Manasseh ended on that note, we might not be surprised. For a man who did so much evil, this might be what he deserved. We might be led to believe that he got what he deserved, and move on to the next chapter. But that’s not how the story ends! Grace interrupts our expectations and turns the story around.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In his distress he sought the favor of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. And when he prayed to Him, the Lord was moved by his prayer and listened to his plea; so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God (2 Chr. 33:12–13).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In his distress Manasseh didn’t seek witches or wizards. He didn’t consult with familiar spirits or the host of heaven. Rather, he prayed to the God of his fathers! It doesn’t look like there’s any hope for such a man. Certainly it doesn’t look like Manasseh would know how to pray, or Who to pray to. But that is the power of God’s grace! And for those who believe that Manasseh only sought the Lord because he was in bondage in Babylon: “And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel” (2 Chr. 33:15–16). That’s what repentance looks like. It tears down the old life, and begins to build a new life. Manasseh’s false gods and altars were torn down, and replaced with the True God and real worship.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, it doesn’t matter how bad you may have been. It doesn’t matter what evil things you have done. The blood of Jesus Christ still cleanses, and the grace of God still saves.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 32-34	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-2-chronicles-28-31-1.png
463	2020-05-31 01:57:53	\N	\N	\N	<p>Ahaz was one of Judah’s worst kings. Ahaz offered sacrifices to heathen gods, made one of his sons pass through fire as a sacrifice (2 Kings 16:3), and did much damage to the Temple (2 Chr. 29).</p><p>Hezekiah reversed the atrocities his father caused. He purged Judah of his father’s idolatry. He restored the Temple and reintroduced true worship. Furthermore, he reestablished the Passover as a national celebration. Hezekiah was a man of godly character and resolve. It seems this account of Hezekiah’s reign is centered around the Temple, the Levites, and the sacrifices. Though there is conflict with Sennacherib, king of Assyria, God gives Judah victory. Which solidifies the thought that if we place God at the center of our lives we will have victory in the other parts.</p><p>It’s remarkable to see the contrast between one generation and another. Ahaz was vile and forsook the God of his fathers. Hezekiah did the exact opposite of Ahaz and clung to God. There is nothing that says you have to fall into the same vices and sins of your parents. You can decide to live for God despite faulty upbringing.</p>	100	\N	2 Chronicles 28-31	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-28-31.png
471	2020-05-20 20:51:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>At the conclusion of David’s life he gave a final charge to Solomon, his heir apparent. David had amassed a wealth of material for the future Temple. David said, “Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance” (1 Chr. 29:2). All of these materials had been collected from conquered nations (2 Sam. 8:7-11).</p><p>Notice what David said next, “Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of the my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house” (1 Chr. 29:3). David gave more out of his own abundance than he did from the materials he had obtained from the conquered nations. Why would David give more? The answer: “because I have set my affection to the house of my God.” Israel’s treasury wasn’t going to out give David. David’s chief joy was the house of the Lord.</p><p>Jesus said, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<br />But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” (Mt. 6:19-21). David’s treasure was the Lord and the Lord’s house, not in his gold and silver. The heart of David was consumed with Jehovah.</p><p>The word “affection” in the Hebrew means to “take pleasure in.” Do you take pleasure or delight in the things of the Lord? Asaph wrote, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee” (Ps. 73:25). Asaph declared there was nothing else on earth that he desired more than God. In a world full of material possessions, and modern conveniences, can we say the same? Beloved, let us set our affections upon the Lord.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 28-29	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-28-29.png
464	2020-05-30 01:52:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>Uzziah, king of Judah, reigned for 52 years. That’s a rather long tenure. One who would reign that long might come to believe they could do anything. That’s the trap Uzziah fell into.</p><p>The Chronicler wrote, “But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense” (2 Chr. 26:16). Uzziah’s name meant “The Lord is my strength.” And it was the Lord who enabled him to prosper as long as sought the Lord (2 Chr. 26:5). Now that Uzziah had some success and peace from his enemies, he began to trust in himself more than in the Lord. The writer of Proverbs said, “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall” (Pro. 16:18). Pride infected Uzziah’s heart and it led to the idea that he believed he could do anything he wanted, like doing the work of a priest.</p><p>Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests followed Uzziah into the Temple. They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense” (2 Chr. 26:16-17). Uzziah had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, but became angry at the priest’s orders. While he was raging at the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead. The priests franticly removed Uzziah from the Temple. He remained a leper in quarantine for the rest of his life (2 Chr. 26:21).</p><p>The epitaph on Uzziah’s tomb was “He is a leper.” What a sad way for a king to be remembered. It would have been one thing had he been born a leper and became king. Instead he was a king who became a leper due to his pride.</p><p>Uzziah lifted himself up, and God brought him low. The apostle Peter wrote, “God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time” (1 Pt. 5:5b-6). God will lift us up if we will humble ourselves. On the other hand, if you attempt to exalt yourself, like Uzziah, God will bring you down.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 25-27	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-25-27.png
465	2020-05-27 22:09:57	\N	\N	\N	<p>The apostle Paul asked the Galatian church, “Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth” (Gal. 5:7)? That same question could be asked of Joash, king of Judah. Joash became king of Judah at the tender age of seven. As long as he listened to the godly counsel of Jehoiada, he did well. The two of them spearheaded the restoration of the long-neglected Temple.</p><p>But when Jehoiada passed away, Joash was influenced by the other leaders of Judah to worship idols. “Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear” (2 Chr. 24:17-19).</p><p>Joash was too easily influenced by others. He reminds me of Mr. Pliable from John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. Pliable was interested Christian’s journey toward the Wicket-Gate, but as soon as things went awry, Pliable went back to his old way of life. Too many people are like Mr. Pliable, and Joash, they are easily influenced. Some are so pliable that they can be fashioned into anything, they will adapt to any group of people they are around. They’ll say or do anything to be accepted.</p><p>Sadly, there are Christians who will compromise convictions and doctrine to be acknowledged or considered popular. They will deviate from the exclusivity of the Christian message; they will bend their convictions of holiness to be accepted by the world; and they will assail doctrinal truths to be considered more tolerant. But if you get them around a different set of people, they will embrace whatever doctrines and values that that particular group holds. Paul says such people are not rooted in truth, and consequently are tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine (Eph. 4:14).</p><p>Beloved, there is safety in a multitude of counselors, but let us make sure we are listening to godly counsel (Pro. 14:11), and not that which will lead us away from truth.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 21-24	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-21-24.png
466	2020-05-27 01:59:25	\N	\N	\N	<p>Sometimes good people associate with bad people. That’s the short story of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. Under Jehoshaphat’s leadership Judah experienced growth and blessing. He was devoted to the God of Israel, and even removed the high places out of reverence to Him. The king of Judah had the priests teach the people from the Law (2 Chr. 17:7-9).</p><p>Though Judah encountered revival during Jehoshaphat’s reign, he made the mistake of getting involved with the wrong kinds of people. He visited Ahab, king of Israel, and agreed to fight with Ramoth-gilead (2 Chr. 18:1-3). Ahab was the vilest of Israel’s kings, and for Jehoshaphat to make an alliance with him was quite troubling. In fact the Lord sent a prophet to him to say so (2 Chr. 19:1-2).</p><p>You’d think that Jehoshaphat would have never made friends with evil people again after the Lord’s rebuke. But that’s what he did. He joined himself with Ahab’s predecessor, Ahaziah, who also did wickedly. The two of them had ships built to travel to Ohpir for the purpose of bringing back gold (1 Kings 22:48). The Lord wasn’t pleased with the alliance and the ambition and He destroyed the ships before they could set sail.</p><p>Jehoshaphat was a godly man who just couldn’t shake his affinity to associate with bad people. The people of God desire to be an influence for good. But there are times that we have to shun those who desire to influence us for evil. If there are people who always create drama, keep the lines of gossip open, and propagate jealousy and envy, then you need to disassociate yourselves from them. The apostle Paul said, “Do not be misled: Bad company corrupts good character” (1 Cor. 15:33). Believers must be kept from the sins of this world, and not have fellowship with darkness, or with anyone who would attempt to draw them away from the light of the Lord (2 Cor. 6:14-17).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 18-20	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-18-20.png
467	2020-05-26 01:51:08	\N	\N	\N	<p>Salt is produced from the combination of two of the most deadly chemicals known to man — sodium, an unstable metal that can burst into flame if exposed to air or water, and chlorine, one of the deadliest gases. When these two deadly chemicals are combined they produce sodium chloride, also known as common table salt. Salt is the only known rock that humans consume.</p><p>The word “salt” comes from the Latin word “sal,” which means salt. Salt was once a valuable commodity, and it was used as a currency. The English word “salary” comes from the word salt. It has been said there are more than 14,000 uses for salt. Salt is used for flavoring and preserving food. It also used in tanning, dyeing, and producing soap, pottery, and chlorine. Salt is also used in melting icy roads, and for agricultural uses. Furthermore, salt purifies, heals, and preserves.</p><p>The Lord commanded the priests to season the grain offerings with salt: “And every offering of your grain offering you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt” (Lev. 2:13 NKJV). The Lord didn’t ask for honey or sugar to be added, He insisted on salt. The addition of salt to the grain offering represented an everlasting relationship between God and His people.</p><p>In the Ancient Near East salt was exchanged as a symbol when treaties or alliances were made. Salt signified that the relationship or agreement was perpetual. The use of the salt in the sacrifices was a reminder that God’s covenant with Israel indissoluble. We should also note that salt impedes the growth of leaven. Paul said that a little leaven leavens the whole lump (Gal. 5:9). Leaven, as a type of sin, is dangerous. But the use the addition of salt can kill the leavening agent.</p><p>When God made a covenant with David, it was said, “The Lord gave the kingdom to David forever by a covenant of salt” (2 Chr. 13:5). The covenant between God and David was everlasting (2 Sam. 7). In light of the covenant of salt, the word of Jesus become more important: “Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another” (Mk. 9:50). To be salt and light in the world we must be seasoned with salt, which only comes through being united with Jesus Christ in the everlasting covenant of salt.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 13-17	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-13-17.png
468	2020-05-24 01:03:15	\N	\N	\N	<p>Some Bible commentators calculate that the Queen of Sheba traveled close to 1,500 miles just to visit Solomon. Upon her arrival she observed Solomon’s splendid kingdom, and servants. She then had her questions answered and the secrets of her heart revealed by Solomon (2 Chr. 9:1-6).</p><p>Notice, if you will, the verbs used to describe the queen. She “heard”; she “came”; she “communed”; she “seen”; she “said”; she “gave”; and she “turned and went away.” Her long trip to see Solomon would not be wasted. This was an opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>The Queen of Sheba seen with her eyes. She heard with her ears. She spent her time in communion. She gave of her abundance. She professed with her mouth the blessings of the Lord. The sad part of her story, however, is that she returned back to her land, without the God of Israel in her heart. Chances are high that she went back to her gods in her homeland, though she had experienced the glories of the God of Israel.</p><p>Often times people come a long way to hear the gospel, commune with church people, and see God’s blessings only to return to their old way of life. They profess faith with their mouths, but their hearts are far from God. Though they travelled far, they didn’t make the most of the opportunity. In other words, so close but so far away.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Chronicles 9-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Chronicles-9-12.png
472	2020-05-20 02:33:19	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Chapter 24 enumerates the twenty-four classes of priests that would serve in the future Temple. Each priest and man had a place and purpose to serve within the Temple. Chapter 25 lists the members of the musical staff. These people sang, and played before the Lord. One man, however, stands out from our reading today.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“All these were sons of Heman the king’s seer. They were given him through the promises of God to exalt him. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. All these men were under the supervision of their father for the music of the temple of the Lord, with cymbals, lyres and harps, for the ministry at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman were under the supervision of the king” (1 Chr. 25:5-6).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Heman was the grandson of Samuel, and also from the Levite tribe of Korah (1 Chr. 6:33; 15:17). Scripture reveals that Heman was a seer, a singer and musician (1 Chr. 25:1; 2 Chr. 5:12; 35:15). Psalm 88 is also accredited to Heman.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, the Lord had fulfilled a promise to give him children. The music that came from Heman and his family was prophetic. Notice that their music was given for the music of the Temple of the Lord, and for the ministry at the house of God (1 Chr. 25:6). Heman didn’t raise his children to use their gifts anywhere other than the house of God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you feel insignificant in the grand scheme of God’s kingdom. Perhaps you feel like you are overlooked for doing the hard work of raising your children in the house of the Lord. I want you to know, beloved, God is taking notice. If God included Heman’s name and family in Scripture for simply singing and playing music in the house of the Lord, then He also sees your labor and faithfulness.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 25-27	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-1-chronicles-15-17-3.png
473	2020-05-18 15:48:25	\N	\N	\N	<p>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth (2 Samuel 7:8-9).</p><h1>Go Do What’s in Your Heart</h1><p>Fifteen years had passed since David was anointed to be king over Israel to the actual fulfillment of becoming king over all of Israel. One of the first tasks that David accomplished was bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, the newly appointed capital of Israel. Following that David organized the priests to offer sacrifices and praises unto the Lord.</p><p>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all of his enemies David told Nathan, the prophet, “Lo, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains” (2 Sam. 7:2; 1 Chr. 17:1). David desired to build the Lord a dwelling place. David thought it strange that he dwelled in a house of cedar, but the Lord’s Ark was dwelling in a tent, more than likely made out of goatskins.</p><p>The prophet said to David, “Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee” (2 Sam. 7:3;1 Chr. 17:2). We should note that David was more concerned for God’s house than his own majesty. Here is the newly crowned king, and his desire is for the Lord. What a contrast from Israel’s previous monarch, king Saul. He was man obsessed with keeping his throne. Saul never sought the Ark of the Covenant, and only offered sacrifices when in trouble. David’s first tasks were to get the Ark, build altars, gather the priests, and build a temple.</p><p>Oh, for sanctified desires! David’s desire was for the Lord and for the Lord’s dwelling. Placing the Lord first in our lives brings about blessings and favor. Putting our own desires behind that of the Lord’s yields great results.</p><p>The first verse says there was rest for David at this time. There weren’t any giants to face. No jealous kings chasing him. No enemy armies surrounding him. Prosperity often times is more dangerous than any outward enemy. Poverty has killed its thousands, but prosperity has killed its tens of thousands! David’s main desire during a time of rest and prosperity was still for the Lord.</p><p>If the only time you seek the Lord, and think of the things of the Lord is when you have an enemy breathing down your neck, then you will certainly become vulnerable during the times of rest and prosperity. Some wonder why they are always facing trials and temptations, maybe that’s the only way the Lord can keep you close to him. If he allowed you rest on every side you’d run to the closest pagan god. Many during this time of a pandemic, have become spiritual. But as soon as life gets back to some sort of normalcy, the church will become a non essential just like it was before a pandemic.</p><p>The Lord should be our desire and delight whether we are in the throes of a storm, or in the tranquility of rest.</p><h1>The Lord’s Answer</h1><p>The Lord appeared unto Nathan and told him to give David a message. The Lord basically said “no” to David’s temple building ambition. In essence, the Lord revealed that David’s son, Solomon, would build the Temple. We will continue to the rest of the God’s message to David, but I want to pause and consider something.</p><p>Everyone can’t be Temple builders. It was David’s desire, but it wasn’t his calling. Some would be disappointed and feel rejected. But God had a higher calling for David, an eternal throne. Solomon had the calling and ability to build the Temple. But Solomon wasn’t the warrior that David was. There are some who are gifted to build Temples, and others who are gifted to fill the Temple with the songs that will be sung.</p><p>Now, if we read on in 2 Samuel, and 1 Chronicles David doesn’t take God’s answer as rejection. The fact that one is rejected from one act of service, does not mean that they are eliminated from all acts of service.</p><p>There are some who are biblically qualified to do particular works in the Kingdom of God. There are others, who according to the Bible, are not qualified to do a particular work. Just because you may not be permitted to do one type of service in God’s Kingdom, does not mean you cannot do anything in the Kingdom.</p><p>David had the correct desire, but it wasn’t his calling (2 Chr. 6:7-9). Again, let’s look back at king Saul. Saul was anointed to be king over Israel. He wasn’t, however, permitted to offer sacrifices. Yet, that’s what he tried to do in an act to appease the opinions of his people. If Saul had been wise, he should have reminded himself of his kingly duties and excused himself from the responsibilities of the priesthood. Everybody needs a good excuse to get out of something. Saul believed that, as did King Uzziah later on in Scripture.</p><p>Sometimes it’s not the achievement of a task, but it’s the attitude. Saul didn’t repent. David, on the other hand, was humbled by God’s rejection and realized all of the things God had done for him (2 Sam. 7:18-19).</p><p>The desire might be right, but if the qualification isn’t met, then the right attitude is needed. Not everyone is called to be a preacher. And that is okay. Not everyone is called to be a pastor. That is perfectly acceptable. Not everyone has the ability to get out front and lead worship.</p><p>Some have made shipwreck of their life and families because they didn’t take God’s rejection with a good attitude. They either go off and do it anyway without God’s help. Or they end up going church to church leaving a trail of wounded pastors and saints in their path.</p><p>Do you know what David did? He gathered the materials, prepared the workers, trained the priests, and ordained the gatekeepers. Though David wasn’t to be the one who built the Temple, he supported the one who was able to.</p><p>Can we do the same? If you can’t be the one out front, can you still support the one that is? If you didn’t get the position, can you still help them with the cause? Is the cause greater than your calling? Is the mission greater than your ministry? If you can’t build, can you prepare? If God has said “no” to you you can make it possible for someone else to fill that place on which you had set your heart.</p><p>Has the Lord said “no” to some calling or position that you desire? Before you turn in resentment, go and sit before the Lord and recount His blessings in your life (2 Sam. 7:18).</p><h1>From the Pasture to the Palace</h1><p>The Lord said, “I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel” (1 Chr. 17:7). David went from being a shepherd to a sovereign because of God’s grace and love. God reminded David of his humble beginnings. David wasn’t born a king, he was born a son of a shepherd. The Lord continued and said, “And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee.” God took a ruddy little shepherd boy and made him into Israel’s king.</p><p>Now, let’s look at this from a different angle. God knew what He was doing in answering David’s desire. God padded the rejection with some reminders. God didn’t need David to be a Temple builder, he needed him to be a king.</p><p>The process from the pasture to the palace is what many want to avoid. They want the palace without the process. Time and distance existed between David’s initial call and the fulfillment of it. Could David have been the great king he was without the process he went through? I don’t believe so. David learned how to be dependent on the Lord during those transformative years.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, God may take His time to develop you and your calling. Israel was in need of a great man to lead them. Before David could lay claim to that role, there were giants to be killed, rejection to be experienced, jealousy to endure, cold caves to be slept in and a whole lot of prayer and patience. Don’t forsake the process between the pasture and the palace.</p><blockquote><p>“And I was with thee whitersoever thou wentest&#8230;” (2 Sam. 7:9).</p></blockquote><p>From the pasture to the palace David was accompanied by God’s presence. God was with David in the pasture while he watched over his father’s lambs. God was with David when Samuel anointed him to be king. God was with David when Goliath fell down dead at his feet. God was with David when the crowds cheered his name. God was with David when Saul threw javelins at him in the throne room. God was with David, and his rag-tag team of followers when they were running from Saul and hiding in cold caves. God was with David at the loss at Ziklag. God was with David when he gave up and decided to live with the Philistines.</p><p>Between the pasture and the palace, there is a process. But you if you’re going to make it then you’ll need God’s presence.</p><p>If you’re going to do anything great for the Lord, then you’ll need to be able to endure the process. Fifteen years lapsed from the anointing of David to the fulfillment. The Presence of the Lord made the difference in his life.</p><p>When God saves us from our sin, there is a process. Paul says we are justified at the beginning, but the end is glorification (Rom. 8:29-30). In between the justification and the glorification is the sanctification. It’s the process by which we become more like Christ. It is the work of the Spirit that conforms us into the image of Jesus Christ.</p><p>David was chosen from his father’s pastures, and chosen to sit upon the throne of Israel. Now look at the places from which the Lord brought us from.</p><h2>He’s taken some of us from:</h2><ul><li>The prison house to the penthouse</li><li>The barstool to the church pew</li><li>False doctrine to truth</li><li>Liars to leaders</li><li>Victims to victors</li><li>Sinners to saints</li><li>Pitiable to prayer warriors</li><li>Drug users to gospel peddlers</li><li>Whoremongers to worshipers</li><li>From the pasture to the palace</li></ul><p>But one thing remains from the beginning to the end, and that’s His Presence.</p><h1>From the Palace to the Pasture</h1><p>David’s greater Son, Jesus Christ, was the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant of Second Samuel chapter seven. He would be the Son of David that would sit on the eternal throne. The references to David’s son have double fulfillment:</p><blockquote><p>“And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever” (2 Samuel 7:12-13).</p></blockquote><p>This is prophecy concerning Solomon, and Jesus Christ. As son of David he also is Son of God:</p><blockquote><p>“Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead” (Romans 1:3-4).</p></blockquote><p>In Second Samuel 7 the word “house” is found no less than thirteen times. The word “dwell” is used four times. If there is anything that we can glean from this amazing chapter, is that God is concerned about dwelling with His people. Furthermore, the significance of the house and the dwelling is the name:</p><blockquote><p>“He shall build an house for my name&#8230;.to redeem a people to Himself, and to make Him a name&#8230;.and let thy name be magnified forever” (2 Sam. 7:13,23,26).</p></blockquote><h2>God built Himself a house and placed His name upon it:</h2><blockquote><p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth” (John 1:1-3,14).</p><p>“And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end” (Luke 1:31-33).</p></blockquote><p>God took David from the pasture to the palace. But Jesus would come from the Palace of Heaven to the Pasture of Bethlehem. God made David into something that He wasn’t &#8211; a shepherd into a King. Jesus became what He wasn’t &#8211; God into man. God made David into a king to be over Israel. Jesus became man that we might be come joint-heirs with Christ, a royal priesthood. For David to be an ancestor of Christ was a great honor. But an even greater honor is to be united to Jesus Christ</p><p>Just when you think that God can’t do something with your life, remember David. More importantly, remember Jesus Christ. He became what He wasn’t so we could become what we weren’t.</p>	100	\N	From the Pasture to the Palace	\N	/rsz_zoltan-tasi-mp3vnhhitxy-unsplash.png
474	2020-05-16 13:48:48	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Though David wasn’t able to build a house for the Lord, he did everything in his power to get the materials and make preparations for the future structure. David insured Solomon’s success, though David would never see it. Dave said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it” (1 Chr. 22:5).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Paul wrote, “[F]or the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children” (2 Cor. 12:14b KJV). The phrase “lay up” in the Greek means to “treasure up” or “store up.” David stored up for Solomon’s future. The writer of Proverbs adds, “A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children.” David labored feverishly for a future that he wouldn’t get to personally experience. David served his generation, but he also served future generations (Acts 13:36).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There were many well-intentioned saints of past generations who lived only for their day. They were taught that the Lord’s return was imminent and they should take no regard for the future. While we believe the Lord Jesus is coming back, and His return is nearer than before, we should also prepare and live as if He won’t come for another hundred years. Our children, and future generations need to be invested in, even if we never get to experience it for ourselves. Hezekiah didn’t care that future generations would suffer for his mistakes, as long as it was peace and safety in his own days (2 Kings 20:19). That’s not how David thought, and that’s not how we should think either.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The gospel didn’t go with Jesus when He ascended into heaven. No, Jesus had invested the message of the Kingdom into twelve men, and they in turn were to invest it into others (Matt. 28:18-19). The apostle Peter said the promise was for his present generation, and the generations to come (Acts 2:38-39). Beloved, let us lay up for future generations just as David did.</p>\r\n	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 22-24	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-1-chronicles-15-17-1.png

Furthermore, these are not easy questions to ask if you consider yourself a Christian. If we come up with the wrong answer, then it could disrupt our faith. If we answer biblically, however, we can bolster our faith.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>God’s Purpose for Creating</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible opens and declares: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. 1:1). The story of creation begins with a Person, not a thing. It all begins with God. God existed before there was a world. The apostle John wrote, “All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made” (Jn. 1:3). Additionally, the apostle Paul wrote, “For by Him were a all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or power: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist” (Col. 1:16-17). Putting those two statements together we can conclude that God created all things, and all things were created <em>for</em> Him. This is foundational for the answers to our questions. God is Creator, and He created everything for His glory.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The heavens and earth declare the glory of God and worships Him (Ps. 19:1-4; 89:5). The sea roars, the floods clap, and the hills make a joyful noise unto the Lord (Ps. 98:7-8). The earth’s inanimate objects glorify and honor the One who has created (Ps. 148:1-14).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The capstone of God’s creation was man, for man was created in God’s image (Gen. 1:26-27). Along with all of creation, God created man to glorify and worship Him. The psalmist wrote, “Ascribe to the Lord, o heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name; worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness (Ps. 29:1-2). There is glory and worship <em>due</em> His name. Paul added that God predestined us to the praise of His grace, and glory (Eph. 1:5-6;14). Furthermore, at the consumption of all things, all of creation will sing: “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things” (Rev. 4:11). From the very beginning God was to be worshiped, and for all of eternity God will be worshiped.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Worship is the expression of our devotedness to God. Humanity and its worship of God were corrupted because of sin. Sin had devastating effects on worship. Man’s heart became corrupted, which led to man worshiping creation more than the Creator (Rom. 1:21-25). The restoration of man and worship was God’s priority behind the incarnation of Christ. Jesus told the Samaritan woman, “God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth” (Jn. 4:24). The woman believed that true worship would happen when the Messiah would come. Jesus declared, “I that speak unto thee am he” (Jn. 4:25-26). Jesus had come to do the will of God, restore broken humanity, and reinstitute true worship.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But our questions are why did God create if He knew man would fall? Or wouldn’t it have been easier for God to just either not create anything at all? Or why didn’t He create man without the ability to sin? Such theological and philosophical questions have been argued and debated for centuries. It’s not my aim to attempt to enter the arena with theological and philosophical giants. I neither have the capability, nor the vocabulary to do so. Instead, I want to try help us see things a little clearer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>God’s Will and Man’s Will</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We have already deduced from Scripture that it is God’s will for creation to worship Him. Since sin entered, then is it God’s will that man perish? First, we must answer the question concerning the consequences of sin. Sin distorted man’s worship, but it did much more than that, though that is important. The Hebrew word for “sin” is defined as “to miss the mark.” Sin misses the mark of God’s holiness. It leaves humanity short of God’s righteous standards. God’s holiness and righteousness are intrinsically connected. For God to be holy, then He must be just. A God who is not just, cannot be God. But God is just. And to miss the mark of God’s holiness is to be in debt on God’s ledger. Sin has a cost, and that cost is death (Rom. 6:23). The Lord told Adam that the day He would disobey His commands would be the day he would die (Gen. 2:17). Adam didn’t die the moment he ate of the tree. Instead, the effects of death began to work in him. It was never God’s will that man die. But man made the choice to disobey God, and death entered the scene. Paul wrote, “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners” (Rom. 5:19). God’s justice had to be reconciled with man’s decision to sin. Though Adam did not die at that moment, something else died in place of Adam (Gen. 3:21). In the New Testament, Jesus paid the debt of sin with His death on Calvary. God’s justice had to be met, which Jesus freely accomplished. Like Adam and Eve covered with the skins of a dead animal, believers are clothed with Christ’s righteousness (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This leads to another question: “Does man have free will?” God created man with the ability to choose. Adam’s choice to disobey God and eat from the forbidden tree had disastrous effects on man’s free will. God, however, did not allow sin and evil to frustrate the very purpose of creation, which was to allow man the freedom to determine itself towards doing good. God has permitted, but not caused, man to fall into sin through free will. For instance, when man turns away from God, he does so without the help of God. God does not assist man’s will to sin. On the other hand, when man turns to receive God’s grace, it is God’s own act enabling man’s choice to choose salvation. This is what it called “prevenient grace.” It is God’s act upon man’s will to yield to God’s call to salvation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Does God’s prevenient grace intrude on man’s free will? The work of grace encourages the will to desire to do good. Paul encapsulates this well in Romans 7:15-24. Before conversion sinful man does whatever he pleases, it just doesn’t please God. Now that grace has moved upon man’s will and affections he desires to do the good things he wasn’t previously inclined to do. Grace works to enable man’s will to do good.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Does God’s grace work against man’s free will? If God moves man’s will, this is not opposed to man’s free will to choose. For instance, God’s activity in natural things is not contrary to their nature. For instance, if the wind blows through a tree, the limbs and leaves move naturally. The moving of the limbs and leaves is not against it’s nature. God moves in the will of man in ways that are consistent with man’s willing. God doesn’t coerce man’s will into doing something that it doesn’t want to do. God moves things in a way that is consistent with its nature. Man was created in the image of God, its in man’s nature (though damaged due to sin) to do good.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To answer the question we asked: “Is it God’s will that man perish?” The answer is no. The apostle Peter wrote, “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). God is willing to save, but He will not coerce man to be saved. Someone said the elect is whosever will, and the non-elect are the whosever won’t. Jesus died for those who do not want to believe and who will never believe. The gift of God’s salvation from sin is offered whether accepted or not (1 Tim. 1:15-16; 2:3-6; Titus 2:11-14). Sinners are lost not because of a deficiency in God’s grace, but due to a defect in a sinner’s will. Nothing prevents the worst of sinners to believe in Jesus and be saved except his own fatal refusal to choose it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The will of God is that all be saved, but its not God’s will for that to be accomplished through overriding a person’s will. Again, God did not create robots, He created humans to worship Him. If worship is coerced, then it is no longer worship. I think of the chorus of Bonnie Raitt’s song I Can’t Make You Love Me, “Cause I can’t make you love me if you don’t. You can’t make your heart feel something that it won’t.” Though God created us to worship and love Him, it must be done out of the abundance of the heart and will. God won’t make us love Him if we won’t. But He has provided the means necessary to enable us to change our hearts and wills through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>God’s Foreknowledge</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The original question of “why did God create if He knew man would fall?” becomes puzzling when we think of man’s free will and God’s foreknowledge. Man’s ability to choose or reject God’s call to salvation takes place in time. Scripture reveals that all of time is known through God’s wisdom (Is. 46:10). God is omniscient, or all knowing. He knows the end from the beginning. God foreknows how man will choose, but His foreknowledge does not determine man’s choice. In other words, the events of time and history or known by God because they occur. However, they do not exist because God knows them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>St. Augustine wrestled with this same conundrum. He said, “Just as you do not, by your memory of them, compel past events to have happened, neither does God, by His foreknowledge, compel future events to take place.” He goes on to say, “God foreknows all the things of which He is the Author, but He is not Himself the Author of all that He foreknows.” Origen said something similar, “Divine foreknowledge means not that anything will happen because God knows that it will, but that, because it will happen, God already knows it.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the idea that God foreknows what the believer’s choice would be does not mean that God is coercing the act of belief, or forcing a will to do something it wouldn’t normally do.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>God’s foreknowledge does not make God the Author of events that are contrary to His will. Yes, God knows who will respond to the gospel message and believe. Yes, He knows who will reject the gospel and be damned. Neither of these truths imply that God decided for them in eternity past. Salvation, and the expression of salvation in worship, wouldn’t have any great meaning if God overrode man’s free will to choose.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Why Did God Create?</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If God knew that man would fall and sin, then why did He create? Let’s try to answer this with an analogy. When a man and woman choose to get married and have children they do so with the knowledge that their child may not turn out to be a stellar citizen. Their child may become a scourge to society. But there is also the hope that their child becomes a successful doctor or lawyer who is adored by all. There is always risk in having children. But people keep choosing to have children.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s think about this further. If a couple has a child and that child turns out to be a serial killer as an adult, is it the parent’s fault? Some may want to blame the parents for faulty child-rearing, or poor choices of neighborhoods they lived in or schools they sent their child to. History records many awful people who had very fine parents and upbringing. The parents aren’t culpable for their offspring’s behavior. A parent’s child makes the free choice to either be a scourge to society or a hero.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Parents know their children will make mistakes and make poor choices. That’s part of parenting. While parents don’t know the particulars of a child’s choices in advance, God does. Children bring heart ache and joy all at the same time. It’s the possibility of children bringing joy and fulfillment that leads people to continue procreating.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Wouldn’t the same be true for God the Creator? God’s first son, Adam, disobeyed and sinned. But the Second Adam, Jesus Christ, obeyed and brought salvation. By one son’s offense judgment, condemnation and death reigned. By another Son’s obedience grace, righteousness, and justification reign. By one son’s poor choice, sin abounded. By another Son’s perfect life grace did abound much more (Rom. 5:17-21).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, God knew there was the possibility for humanity to fail. But God also knew there was a great possibility for Him to have a Son who could undo what sin had caused. That Son would extend God’s grace to fallen humanity who would bring us in as sons and daughters that we might cry out in worship, “Abba, Father” (Rom. 8:14-17).</p>\r\n	100	\N	Why Did God Create?	\N	/img_2041-scaled.jpg
476	2020-05-14 20:53:41	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>David was tempted to number the people of Israel (1 Chr. 21:1). Numbering the people was an act of pride and selfish ambition. To number the people indicated self reliance on a large army, instead of depending on the Lord to bring about victory in battle. Power and authority have corrupting capabilities, and pride was the toxin used this time to tempt David. We shouldn’t be surprised to read that it was Satan who provoked David, for it was pride that was his downfall (Isa. 14:12-14).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>God was displeased and decided to censure David for his prideful census. The Lord gave David three options for judgment: three years of famine; three years of destruction from enemies; or three days of pestilence from the Lord (1 Chr. 21:10-12). David said, “I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the Lord; for very great are His mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man” (1 Chr. 21:13). David would rather throw himself at the mercy of the Lord, and chose three days of pestilence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David couldn’t stand to his people suffer for his prideful actions, and cried out to the Lord for mercy (1 Chr. 21:17). The prophet Gad told him to go to the threshing floor of Ornan, build an altar there, and offer sacrifices. David immediately went to Ornan and asked to buy the threshing floor to build the altar. Ornan refused payment and offered the plot of land for free.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David replied to Ornan, “Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without cost” (1 Chr. 21:24). David paid six hundred shekels of gold for the threshing floor. He then built an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings unto the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There was a cost for David’s sin. First, it cost the lives of seventy thousand men (1 Chr. 21:14). Second, it cost David financially to buy Ornan’s threshing floor, and offer sacrifices. David wouldn’t allow Ornan to simply give him the land, because it wasn’t Ornan who sinned.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There’s always a cost to sin, and the only way to pay the debt of sin is with death (Rom. 6:23). Thankfully, Jesus paid the price for our sins through His death at Calvary. </p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 18-21	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-1-chronicles-15-17.png
477	2020-05-14 02:32:50	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>David had successfully brought the Ark of the Covenant safely to Jerusalem, and had organized the priests to offer sacrifices and praises unto the Lord. David truly desired to build a house for the Lord, because the Ark was dwelling in an edifice made of curtains (1 Chr. 17:1). The Lord refused David the opportunity to build a house, for that responsibility would be given to Solomon. Part of the Lord’s response is what I want to draw from today.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord said, “I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel” (1 Chr. 17:7). David went from being a shepherd to a sovereign because of God’s grace and love. God reminded David of his humble beginnings. David wasn’t born a king, he was born a son of a shepherd. The Lord continued and said, “And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee.” God took a ruddy little shepherd boy and made him into Israel’s king.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The process from the sheepcote to the palace is what many want to avoid. They want the palace without the process. Time and distance existed between David’s initial call and the fulfillment of it. Could David have been the great king he was without the process he went through? I don’t believe so. David learned how to be dependent on the Lord during those transformative years.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brothers and sisters, God may take His time to develop you and your calling. Israel was in need of a great man to lead them. Before David could lay claim to that role, there were giants to be killed, rejection to be experienced, jealousy to endure, cold caves to be slept in and a whole lot of prayer and patience. Don’t forsake the process between the sheepcote and the palace.</p>\r\n	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 15-17	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-1-chronicles-12-14-1.png
478	2020-05-12 13:19:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Philistines once again made an appearance, this time as David was crowned king over Israel. David prayed before he made a decision concerning a counter attack (1 Chr. 14:10). Here we see a king who is submitted to the Lord as King. Unlike Saul, David didn’t make a move until he had heard from the Lord. The Lord answered David and said, “Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.” God broke out against the Philistines so much that they left their handmade gods behind (1 Chr. 14:12).</p><p>Unfortunately, the Philistines attacked David once again. What did David do this time around? He enquired of the Lord just as he did previously. But the Lord’s answer was different on this occasion. The Lord said, “Go not up after them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines” (1 Chr. 14:14-15). Previously the Lord had told David to meet the enemy head on. This time, however, God had another tactic to use against the enemy.</p><p>Had David not prayed, and instead done what he had done earlier, then he would have been defeated. David wasn’t to attack until he heard the wind rustling in the mulberry trees. More than likely, David probably experienced some impatience waiting for the wind to rush through those tree limbs. He had to wait on the Lord. Do you remember Saul’s lack of patience? He was told to wait on Samuel, but when he couldn’t wait any longer he “forced” himself to offer a burnt offering (1 Sam. 13:8-16). Saul’s impatience with God’s Word and timing led to his eventual downfall. Who was Saul’s battle with? None other than the Philistines. God’s instruction for victory was to wait on the prophet Samuel to show up. Saul didn’t believe God would take care of the battle, so he took it upon himself. What a contrast between David and Saul!</p><p>Some would like to spiritualize the wind in the mulberry trees. The significance of the story isn’t in the mulberry trees. No, the significance is in David’s enquiry of the Lord, and God’s instructions concerning this particular battle. David didn’t neglect prayer and assume that God would do as before. Instead he sought and waited.</p><p>Beloved, there is much we can learn from this account. First, unlike David our enemy isn’t flesh and blood. Our battles are spiritual (Eph. 6:12). This is why it is crucial that we fight spiritual battles with spiritual weapons. Furthermore, though our enemy remains the same, the battles maybe ever changing and evolving. The one constant that should never change is prayer. No matter the battle, we must always enquire of the Lord. We may question God’s answers and instructions, but we can always be assured of His involvement and victory.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 12-14	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-12-14.png
479	2020-05-12 01:09:36	\N	\N	\N	<p>David and his men were in a cave in Adullum, surrounded by Philistine soldiers (2 Sam. 23:13-17; 1 Chr. 11:15-19). David became thirsty, and homesick for Bethlehem. He said aloud, “Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate” (1 Chr. 11:17). Three of David’s mighty men took his request seriously, risked their lives and went and obtained some of David’s hometown water (1 Chr. 11:18).</p><p>Some believe that loyalty is weakness. Society has cast dispersions at the willingness to serve a leader. These three men should serve as an example of how we should serve Jesus Christ. Let us not forget that these men hadn’t always been so mighty. Scripture says these men were once distressed, discontent, and in debt (1 Sam. 22:2). David’s investment in their lives had given them value. Jesus Christ changed our lives for the better, and the least we can do is serve Him with gladness (Ps. 100:2).</p><p>David held that cup of water in amazement. His men had risked their lives to simply get him a cup of water. The water had become too valuable to drink. David poured the water out and said, “My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it” (1 Chr. 11:19). Three mighty men jeopardized their lives so David could have his thirst quenched. David wasn’t going to drink the water, but instead poured it out as drink offering to the Lord, and chose to be like them, and continued to thirst.</p><p>What a picture of Jesus Christ we have in this narrative. Jesus was from Bethlehem. He is Living Water for the thirsty (Rev. 22:17). Yet, Jesus became thirsty just like us (Jn. 19:28). He poured out His life like water (Ps. 22:14). At the end of the apostle Paul’s life he said to Timothy, “For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand” (2 Tim. 4:6 NKJV). The mighty Paul poured his life out for the gospel, because Jesus Christ had poured out His life for Paul. Let us go and do likewise.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 10-11	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-10-11.png
480	2020-05-10 10:23:52	\N	\N	\N	<p>After the Chronicler listed the genealogies, he switched gears and began to make note of those who returned to Israel after their exile (1 Chr. 9:1-2). Judah was carried away into Babylon for their transgression of the Law. The landscape of Israel certainly changed since their exile. Both Israel and Judah had been raided and destroyed. The twelve tribes’s populations had been decimated. Monarchies were no longer in authority. Things had certainly changed since the Davidic reign.</p><p>Chapter nine is important because a large part of the chapter is spent on the priesthood and their duties. Now that God’s people were returning to their land, they weren’t going to be rebuilding the pagan altars and high places. That’s what got them evicted from the Promised Land in the first place. Additionally, Israel’s kingship wouldn’t be restored, but true worship would be revived.</p><p>One thing was needful in Israel, and that was devotion to Jehovah. Everything else was subservient to that main cause. Israel’s deviation from the Lord led to their demise. If they were going to bear any resemblance as God’s people, then they were going to have to get worship right.</p><p>Jesus said, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Mt. 6:33). Putting God in His rightful place in our life will allow everything else to fall in its rightful position. The Chronicler could have put these genealogies and Temple information at the end of his books. Instead, he placed them first to show how Israel got to be in the position they were in, and what it looked like to get finally get it right.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 7-9	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-7-9.png
481	2020-05-09 02:51:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Chronicler, amidst a litany of genealogical information, stops to tell a short story about an intriguing man. “And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested” (1 Chr. 4:9-10).</p><p>Hebrew parents didn’t flippantly name their children. Names given to children carried significance, and didn’t come from a book of popular baby names. Bible students are familiar with significant names like Isaac, Jacob, Benjamin, and Jesus. Those names carried great importance. Jabez’s name meant “sorrow” or “pain.” Can you imagine naming your child Sorrow? Every time his name would be called it was loaded with pain. Perhaps he was born during a stressful time in his family, or his delivery was painful. Whatever the reason, he was given the name Jabez.</p><p>Even though his name meant sorrow, the Chronicler notes that Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. For all one knows Jabez’s honor maybe due to his honorable prayers. Just because Jabez was born in sorrow, doesn’t mean he was going to be characterized by his name. Too many allow their pain and sorrow to become their crutches. They limp through life as victims. Jabez, on the other hand, used his circumstances to pray bold prayers, and the Lord answered them.</p><p>Jabez prayed for the Lord to bless him and to enlarge his territory. Some might believe these are superficial requests. But from a man who had only known sorrow and disappoint, who could blame him? His last two requests qualify the first two requests: &#8220;that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me.” Jabez didn’t just want to be blessed with material blessings, he wanted to be a better man. A man kept from evil is a blessed man. A man who walks hand in hand with the Lord is a blessed man. Jabez didn’t want to grieve the Lord with evil actions. Jabez’s birth had inadvertently caused grief for his mother. Jabez wasn’t going to allow his life and behavior grieve the Lord. Beloved, that is the description of a blessed man! No wonder the Chronicler stopped to give honor to a man who lived honorably.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-4-6.png
482	2020-05-08 02:37:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>Our daily Bible reading now takes us to the Chronicles. Readers might be led to believe that Chronicles is just a retelling of Samuel and Kings. Though there are some similarities, there remains quite a bit of difference. Especially when it comes to the chronicler’s intent for writing the books. Even the inclusion of detailed genealogies are part of the writer’s intended purpose (1 Chr. 1-9). Keep in mind that the majority of English Bibles aren’t organized chronologically. If they were to be chronologically organized, then Chronicles would be placed last in the Old Testament. With that in mind, Chronicles was written after Judah’s exile and return to the Promised Land. Which gives us some indication for the writer’s purpose, and the books overall theme.</p><p>The book of Second Kings records the Northern Kingdom’s exile and captivity by the Assyrians (2 Kings 18:11-12). It also records the Southern Kingdom’s deportation from Judah to Babylon (2 Kings 24-25). The Israelite people had been completely removed from the Promised Land. Their continued apostasy had come to a climax, and the country was left desolate. The remnant of Judah, which was in Babylon, had very little hope remaining. Babylonian Empire would be overthrown by the Persians around 539 BC. All of what had been Judah (and consequently the Northern Kingdom) then came under Persian rule. Persia’s king, Cyrus, allowed Hebrews exiled in Babylon to return to Judah to rebuild their homeland (2 Chr. 36:22-23; Ezra 2:1-35; Neh. 7:5-73). Judah wouldn’t be an autonomous nation, but would be governed by Persia.</p><p>To those who returned to Judah after the exile, it seemed as if the Lord had forsaken Israel and His promises. The chronicler takes the responsibility to give Israel renewed hope in God’s promises. Although David’s throne had been removed from Jerusalem, God’s covenant with David continued. Furthermore, the Temple had also been destroyed in Jerusalem, but true worship was to continue. Two themes emerge from Chronicles, the throne and the Temple. The genealogies presented in the first nine chapters of First Chronicles prove the line of David was still intact. The last half of First Chronicles gives us great detail of David’s preparation concerning the Temple.</p><p>The writer of Chronicles sets out to prove that God was in control of Israel’s past, despite her misgivings, and He was still in control of their future. Israel no longer had a king sitting upon a throne, but through David’s lineage the King of Kings was to emerge. This Son of David would have an everlasting throne. David’s greater Son, Jesus Christ, would not dwell in a temple made with hands, but heaven would be His throne, and earth would be His footstool (Acts 7:48-49).</p><p>Though Chronicles seems to be a retelling of events that we’ve previously read, and reading the genealogies is about as exciting as reading a telephone book, it has great purpose. That purpose is that God is in control, and His promises are sure. Israel experienced victory, blessings, setbacks, apostasy, revival, good kings, bad kings, exile, and captivity. But God remained faithful. I hear the words of the apostle Paul echo throughout Chronicles, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:35-39).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Chronicles 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Chronicles-1-3.png
483	2020-05-07 02:26:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>Josiah was eight years old when he became Judah’s king (2 Kings 22:1). His reign as Judah’s king was prophesied some 350 years prior. The man of God who prophesied against Jeroboam’s altar, precisely named the king who would burn the bones of evil men upon that wretched altar (1 Kings 13:2). That’s exactly what Josiah did too. He went about Judah tearing down idolatrous places, and destroying pagan worship. But what brought about Josiah’s reforms?</p><p>During the repair of the Temple, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered the Book of the Law (2 Kings 22:8). Shaphan, the scribe, read the Law before king Josiah. Josiah rent his clothes as he heard the words. Immediately he enquired of the Lord to know what to do. Without question the Lord was angry with Judah for their continued idolatry. Judgment was imminent due to Judah’s neglect of God’s Law and their bent towards idolatry. Due to Josiah’s tender and contrite heart, he wouldn’t see God’s punishment during his days (2 Kings 22:19-20).</p><p>Josiah gathered all the elders of Judah and went to the House of the Lord. Josiah read in the ears of Judah the Law of Moses, then made a covenant to keep the commandments and to walk after the Lord (2 Kings 23:1-3). From that moment Josiah began to clean out the Temple, and to remove all of Judah’s idolatrous places. The revival that took place under Josiah was unmatched. There was no king before him that turned to the Lord with all his heart, soul, and might (2 Kings 23:25).</p><p>Once Josiah discovered truth he acted upon it. The Law of Moses had been neglected, and Josiah realized it as he listened to the words read to him. Truth isn’t just to be acknowledged, it is to be obeyed. In doing so, Josiah didn’t waste anytime reforming his life and the people he ruled. The apostle James wrote, “But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves” (Jam. 1:22). Josiah heard the Word and obeyed it. Let us open up the Word of God and discover truth for ourselves, then act upon it!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 22-25	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-22-25.png
484	2020-05-06 01:36:44	\N	\N	\N	<p>Hezekiah was a man of prayer. His obedience to God’s Law and his trust in God’s ways fueled his prayers. When the Assyrians threatened Judah, and defied the Lord God, Hezekiah went to the house of the Lord and prayed (2 Kings 19:1). After the Assyrians sent a written threat to the king, he went to the house of the Lord, spread out the letter before the Lord and prayed (2 Kings 19:14-15). Hezekiah trusted the Lord to give Judah victory over their enemies.</p><p>That wouldn’t be the last time Hezekiah prayed. “In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord, set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live’” (2 Kings 20:1). Previously it was the Assyrians threatening Hezekiah’s life. Now it was the Lord God who was telling Hezekiah that death was imminent. What did Hezekiah do? “Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord” (2 Kings 20:2). If the Lord answered his prayers about the Assyrians, then the Lord could answer his prayer about dying. Hezekiah prayed until he wept.</p><p>Before the prophet Isaiah made it out of the middle court of the palace, the Lord answered Hezekiah’s prayer (2 Kings 20:5)! The Lord healed Hezekiah and added fifteen years onto his life.</p><p>Who did Hezekiah turn to in times of great need? The Lord. Hezekiah wasn’t bashful concerning God’s promises, and or his own faithfulness (2 Kings 19:16-19; 20:3). Leonard Ravenhill said, “A man who kneels before God will stand before men. And a man who is intimate with God will never be intimidated by men.” I think that perfectly sums up Hezekiah.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 20-21	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-20-21.png
485	2020-05-05 02:10:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>After the death of Ahaz, Hezekiah began to reign in Judah, and it was like sunlight breaking through the clouds after a storm. Hezekiah was only twenty five years old when he came to power. Despite his youth, he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings 18:3).</p><p>Revival broke out in Judah under Hezekiah’s leadership. He removed the high places, broke down the idolatrous images, and cut down pagan groves. Unlike his father, he clave unto the Lord, and departed not from following after Him, and obeyed the Law of Moses (2 Kings 18:6). Ahaz, his father, was a vassal for the Assyrians, but Hezekiah, on the other hand, rebelled against Assyria. Needless to say, Hezekiah was the opposite of his father.</p><p>While there was a revival in Judah, there was judgment in Israel. The Assyrians began their siege against Samaria, and began to deport the Israelites (2 Kings 18:9-11). The writer of Kings makes the contrast apparent here. Hezekiah and Judah are returning to the Lord and experiencing prosperity. Israel obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant, and for that they are being taken into captivity (2 Kings 18:12).</p><p>Hezekiah’s revival is quite remarkable. His father was as awful as they come, even sacrificing his children in fire to a pagan god. How did Hezekiah survive that? How does an evil man like Ahaz produce a great man like Hezekiah? It is nothing short of God’s grace.</p><p>Like Hezekiah, there are many who are living testimonies of God’s grace. They grew up in abusive homes, or they had parents who abused substances. Society gave up on them simply based on who their parents were. God, however, had His hand upon them. He awakened their hearts and minds to the realization that the gods their parents served brought them nothing but heartache. Then somehow they were introduced to Jesus and they found hope beyond their environment and upbringing.</p><p>I’m thankful that Jesus doesn’t base His love and salvation upon our genealogy. But the grace of God, that brings salvation, has appeared unto all men (Titus 2:11).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 18-19	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-18-19.png
486	2020-05-03 20:36:48	\N	\N	\N	<p>Some have said that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. When it comes to the church and the world, however, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. That’s what Ahaz attempted to do while king of Judah, and it didn’t end well.</p><p>Ahaz’s father, Jotham, was a good king. Ahaz’s son, Hezekiah, was an even greater king. The kingdom of Judah reached a new low with the reign of Ahaz. Scripture records, “Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God” (2 Kings 16:2 NIV). We are accustomed to reading similar statements about kings in Israel. But this is the only time we read such a statement to describe a Judean king.</p><p>Ahaz was influenced by the kings of Israel (1 Kings 16:3). He didn’t want to be like his father, or like his great-grandfather David. No, Ahaz wanted to be like the evil leaders of Israel. First, he sacrificed his children in fire to a heathen god (2 Kings 16:3; 2 Chr. 28:3). He also worshiped in the high places and on the hills and under every tree tree. The only god Ahaz didn’t worship was Jehovah!</p><p>Syria’s king and Israel’s king attacked Judah. Ahaz appeals the Assyrian king for help. Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the Temple as a bribe to have the Assyrian king come and help him. While Ahaz was in Damascus to meet with the Assyrian king he noticed a beautiful pagan altar (2 Kings 16:10). Ahaz sketched a rendering of the altar and had it sent to Urijah, the priest in Judah. He wanted to have an altar just like it in Judah. Unfortunately, Urijah complied and had the pagan altar built.</p><p>The writer of Second Chronicles notes that God’s judgement was upon Ahaz for his compromise, and the pagan gods he worshiped were his downfall (2 Chr. 28:22-24). At his death he was buried somewhere other than with the godly kings of Judah (2 Chr. 28:27).</p><p>There is a high cost when the church attempts to be like the world. Ahaz wanted to be like the evil kings of Israel, but they ended up wanting to kill him. He wanted to worship like the people in Damascus, who did in fact attack the Judean king. No matter how much the church may want to fashion itself after the world, it will not be accepted. The apostle John wrote to not love the world, or the things of the world (1 Jn. 2:15-17).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 15-17	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-16-18.png

487	2020-05-02 14:55:36	\N	\N	\N	<p>After king Ahaziah’s death, his mother, Athaliah, began killing all of the royal seed (2 Kings 11:1). Athaliah crowned herself queen, and seized the throne in Judah and reigned for six years. Ahaziah’s sister, Jehosheba, took his last remaining son, Joash, and hid him in the house of the Lord for six years (2 Kings 11:2-3).</p><p>Jehoiada the priest, and the husband of Jehosheba, staged a revolt against the self-proclaimed queen, and had her killed. It was then that Joash became king of Judah at a very young age. Fortunately he had the guidance of Jehoiada (2 Kings 12:1-2). Things went well for Joash as long as he listened to the instruction of the priest. We should note the possible influence that Joash’s stay in the Temple, and the influence of the priest had upon him at such a young age. Obviously Joash’s father and grandmother were terrible examples for the child, and had it not been for the priest and the environment of the Temple, Josash may have ended up just like the rest of his family. Despite Joash failing to remove the high places, he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and reigned for forty years in Jerusalem (2 Kings 12:1-3).</p><p>During the awful years of Ahaziah and Athaliah, the house of the Lord had become neglected spiritually and materially. Joash realized that the house of the Lord was in disarray and decided to have it repaired. Joash had a large offering box built and had it located near the altar. The king and the priest encouraged the people to bring offerings for the repairs.</p><p>Joash recognized the importance of the house of the Lord, because it had been the very place that preserved him! Additionally, Joash made sure that priesthood was also taken care of during the building project (2 Kings 12:6-9). The king made sure the priests could continue doing the work of the ministry while the repairs were completed by professionals. Joash seemed to have understood the significance of the both the church, and the ministry of the church.</p><p>Your local church should be the most cared for building in your city. It’s not the building, but it’s what the building represents. It represents the Lord, who we worship! Furthermore, the church leadership shouldn’t be the only ones bearing the responsibility of overseeing the repairs and maintenance of the facilities either. The most important responsibility for pastors and spiritual leaders is prayer and the ministry of the Word (Acts 6:1-6). Let us take care of God’s house, and His ministers. Because we never know when there might be a Joash who needs a godly environment and holy influences.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 12-14	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-12-14.png
488	2020-05-02 00:43:39	\N	\N	\N	<p>On Monday mornings this year at Apostolic Christian School I’ve taught through John Bunyan’s <span style="color: #333399;"><a style="color: #333399;" href="https://banneroftruth.org/us/store/christian-living/pilgrims-progress/"><em>The Pilgrim’s Progress</em></a></span>. Bunyan’s allegory for the Christian life has served as a guide for many generations. I highly recommend everyone to read Bunyan&#8217;s most popular book. I thought it appropriate to use his allegory as a lesson for young people, especially young Christians.</p><h2>Christian: A Man with a Burden and a Book</h2><p>Mr. Bunyan begins his story by introducing the main character, a man named Christian. Christian is described as being clothed with rags, a burden on his back, and a book in his hand.</p><p>The story starts with Christian opening the book and reading. He wept and cried as he read from the book. Not able to contain himself, he broke out with a lamentable cry saying, “What shall I do?!” Christian goes home, and there we are introduced to Christian’s wife and children.</p><p>Christian tells his wife, “By reason of a burden that lies upon me, I am certain that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven, we must escape and be delivered.” Unfortunately, Christian’s family did not believe him. They were concerned about his well-being, but not for his soul, or for their own souls. His wife and children urged him to lay down and get some rest. When their advice didn’t seem to cure what ailed Christian, they attempted to mock and deride him for his fear of divine punishment. Despite his family’s interventions, Christian continued to be troubled by the burden, and the city’s impending doom.</p><h2>A Burden</h2><p>Christian was weighted down with a great burden upon his back. Like Christian, all humanity is under the weight of sin (Rom. 3:23). Read what David said concerning the weight of sin:</p><blockquote><p>“Because of your anger, my whole body is sick; my health is broken because of my sins. My guilt overwhelms me— it is a burden too heavy to bear” (Psalm 38:3–4 NLT).</p></blockquote><p>Sin is a heavy burden to bear. Christian is so over burdened with sin that he buckles under the heavy weight. Christian longs to be relieved from his burden. His family’s attempts of helping were insufficient. Sin cannot be admonished, or counseled. Christian wasn’t going to be able to sleep away his sin. Christian needed divine relief.</p><p>The awareness of our sin is the first step towards repentance. David says elsewhere, “For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:3). Christian had been awakened to the fact that he had been carrying a weight that he cannot rid himself of.</p><p>Young person, you have begun to feel the burden of life upon your shoulders, back, and mind. Particular worries and fears, that you have evaded for 17-18 years, have suddenly been lowered upon your shoulders. Your family has until this point carried these burdens for you. Now, however, you begin to feel them. You’ve always wanted to be an adult and now its here. But for the rest of your life you will desire to go back to being a child or teenager. By reason of life’s burdens you will want to be free, just as you have been these past years.</p><p>Life’s burdens pale in comparison to the burden of sin. Perhaps you’ve been taught through various Bible classes, and church services that sin is very real. The sense of sin will never escape you. The greatest way to lighten the load of life’s burden is to be sure to be free from the burden of sin.</p><h2>A Book</h2><p>Christian is described as having a burden on his back, but he also has a book in his hand. This book is none other than the Bible. Christian feels the weight of his sin, but is also moved by what is revealed in the Book.</p><p>Young person, your days have been filled with books for the past twelve years. Science; Math; English; Shakespeare; Geography; Playbooks; Health; Government; Econ and much more. The greatest book, however, is the Bible. No education is complete unless it has the Bible at the forefront. You may reference other books, but only one Book should be your guide, and that is the Bible.</p><p>Do not neglect your Bible. Turn to it time and time again. There is no greater Book than the Bible.</p><h2>Evangelist and Mr. Worldly Wiseman</h2><p>Christian was in a certain field reading his Book, and as he read he felt distressed and cried out, “What shall I do to be saved?” Christian felt like running, but he couldn’t decide which way to run. It was at this moment that a man named Evangelist walked towards him, asked, “Wherefore dost thou cry?”</p><p>Evangelist handed Christian a parchment roll, and there was written within it, “Fly from the wrath to come.” Christian didn’t know where to fly off to. Then Evangelist pointed his finger over a wide field and said, “Do you see yonder Wicket-Gate?” Christian couldn’t see the gate. So Evangelist told Christian to focus his sight on the Light, and the Light would lead to the Wicket-Gate. Once Christian arrived at the Wicket-Gate he was to knock on the door, and it would be told him what he was to do (Matt. 7:7-8).</p><p>Evangelist represents the preacher. Christian was in need of a guide, someone who could point him in the right direction. This is the duty of every minister. Preachers are to be able to point people towards the relief they desperately need. Evangelist didn’t point Christian towards himself, rather he pointed him towards the Light and Wicket-Gate. Evangelist wasn’t the answer, but he had the answer.</p><p>Young person, you have been blessed with many great teachers and preachers. All of your spiritual leaders have tried their best to point you to the light. They’ve equipped you and given you the tools to get you where you need to go. Evangelist helped Christian later on after he listened to some terrible advice from Mr. Worldly Wise-Man.</p><p>Mr. Worldly Wiseman pointed Christian in the wrong direction after Christian’s Slough of Despond encounter. Mr. Worldly Wiseman told him the exact opposite of what Evangelist told him to do. Christian ended up behind a mountain and far away from his intended place of Wicket-Gate. Evangelist found Christian and set him on the right path again.</p><p>Evangelist revealed the errors in Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s advice:</p><ul><li>He loves the world’s doctrine.</li><li>His religion is morality.</li><li>His morality keeps him from the Cross.</li><li>He wants to turn people from the Way.</li><li>He believes the Cross is repulsive.</li><li>He presents his own way as the easier way.</li></ul><p>As you journey through life you are going to meet many people who want to give you advice and counsel. You will hear the diatribes of secular professors who will point you away from Jesus. You will have friends who will attempt to guide you away from Truth. There will be others who will say it’s impossible for one to know truth. Others will make you believe that sin and salvation are nothing more than a state of mind. However, any advice that attempts to remove the Cross, or to minimize salvation by grace should be avoided. Counsel that tries to get you to leave the narrow path for the broad path should be evaded.</p><p>I encourage you to keep that Book in your hands, and keep true spiritual leaders in close proximity. Take heed how you hear, but also take heed to who you listen to.</p><h2>Unbelieving Family, Mocking Neighbors, and Unreliable Acquaintances</h2><p>Once Christian left his hometown and journeyed towards the Wicket-Gate, his neighbors and family began to mock him. His wife believed him to be a fool who had lost his mind. His neighbors believed he was on a wild goose chase. Christian put his fingers into his ears and ran towards Wicket-Gate. Like David, you may have to encourage yourself in the Lord. While others mock, you’ll have to put your fingers into your ears and follow the leading of God’s Spirit towards relief.</p><p>Two men that came alongside Christian were Obstinate and Pliable.</p><p>Obstinate became convinced that Christian was out of his mind. Obstinate didn’t want to hear such foolishness from Christian’s Book. The thought of believing in Christian’s pursuit was absurd to Obstinate. From that moment Obstinate decided to go back to the City of Destruction and continue living as he had always done. Christian wasn’t going to be able to change Obstinate’s mind.</p><p>First, you are going to meet many obstinate people on your Christian pilgrimage. You will have family members calling for you to return to the old life. There will be friends and neighbors who will call you foolish or brainwashed. The Bible refers to such people as “stubborn” (Deut. 10:16; Ps. 81:12; Acts 19:9); “hard-hearted” (Pro. 28:14); and “stiff-necked” (Ex. 32:9; Acts 7:51). People who are unyielding to God’s Word and Spirit are obstinate, and you will never change their minds with mere arguments (Col. 2:4). It will have to be the work of the Holy Spirit to change their hearts and minds (Ezk. 36:26).</p><p>Second, do not be like Obstinate. Now, this is a paradox. If we are to be steadfast in what we believe (Acts 2:42), and defend what we believe (1 Pt. 3:15-16), how are we any different than Obstinate? Here is the difference: Obstinate was stubbornly adhering to his opinions and preferences. On the other hand Christian was unyielding in his belief in God’s Word. It’s one thing to be obstinate about preferences, it’s another thing to be committed to the One who doesn’t change (Mal. 3:6)! Preferences and opinions can change, but the Word of God is forever settled in heaven (Ps. 119:89)!</p><p>While Obstinate turned around and went home, Pliable was very interested in the things to be received in this eternal kingdom. He kept asking, and Christian kept answering. The thought of these blessings excited Pliable so much that he wanted to pick up the pace of their traversing.</p><p>Unfortunately, Christian and Pliable came upon a swampy area called the Slough of Despond. Both men fell into the swamp-like substance and began to sink. Pliable was able to get himself out of the slough. Christian, on the other hand, was bogged down with the weight of the burden on his back, and unable to help himself get out.</p><p>Once Pliable was out of the mud he became very angry with Christian. He didn’t attempt to help Christian, but instead chastised him for not warning him of this type of danger.</p><p>Chances are great that you will come to your own Slough of Despond. Problems, issues, grief, loss, and failure are part of every journey. Pliable wasn’t willing to endure, so he went back home too.</p><p>The word “pliable” is defined as “flexible,” “easily bent,” “easily influenced,” and “adaptable.” This accurately describes Pliable in Mr. Bunyan’s allegory. You shouldn’t be Obstinate, but you shouldn’t be like Pliable either. Pliable was willing to be conformed to the world around him. Christians are to be transformed by God. Beloved, we must be pliable so we can be transformed into the image of God. We mustn’t be like Mr. Pliable that we are conformed to the fashions of this world.</p><h2>The Cross</h2><p>When Christian finally arrives to the Cross, his burden slips from off his back, and rolls into an empty tomb. Christian stands and begins to rejoice that his burden had been removed.</p><p>In like manner, our burden of sin is removed by the Cross of Jesus Christ. At Calvary we take all of our burdens to have them removed. The Cross isn’t a pit-stop on life’s journey. The Cross is the center of our life. Because it’s easy to pick up other burdens after we have encountered Calvary.</p><p>The interesting part of Christian’s journey, is that Wicket-Gate and the Cross weren’t final destinations. Christian’s final destination was the Celestial City. But Christian doesn’t arrive at the Cross to be transported to the Celestial City. No, the journey continues. Christian now lives, and behaves in light of the Cross.</p><p>After Christian’s encounter at the Cross, he travels to Difficulty Hill, Palace Beautiful, the Valley of Humiliation, the Valley of the Shadow of Death, Vanity Fair, Doubting Castle, Delectable Mountains, and Dark River.</p><p>Christian would have never survived had it not been for his experience at the Cross.</p><p>Have you had your Cross encounter yet? Have you met the One who can relieve you of your burden? Because you too will face difficulties; monsters at the Valley of Humiliation; shadows of darkness, despair in the castle of doubt; deep waters of trouble; and persecution in a secularized culture.</p><h2>Progress On</h2><p>Like Christian you will meet people like Obstinate; Pliable; Mr. Worldly Wiseman, Formalist and Hypocrisy; Apollyon; Mr. Talkative; Giant Despair; Ignorance; Flatterer; and Atheist. They will only seek to hold you back, and drag you down.</p><p>You’ll need friends like Evangelist; Good-Will; Interpreter; Faithful; Hopeful; Discretion; Prudence; Piety; Charity; Knowledge; Experience; Watchful; and Sincere. All of these friends will encourage you to get where you are going!</p><p>Life is a journey made up of progressions. Scripture employs many metaphors for progressing in the Christian life: walking (2 Cor. 5:7; Gal. 5:16); running (1 Cor. 9:24-26); growing (Eph. 4:15); maturing (Col. 1:28). Don’t put roots down with anyone or with anything that keeps you from progressing in life.</p><p>The Puritans, like John Bunyan, taught that Christians were to live with their bags packed and ready to go. We aren’t to pursue what this world has to offer. We shouldn’t put our roots down in this place, but instead live as to pursue our Celestial City of Heaven. If you will keep your eyes towards heaven, then it will be heaven that you attain. But such a pursuit isn’t without its difficulties. But you must endure and you must continue to progress. You must carry on. You must continue on the young person’s progress to adulthood, and the Pilgrim’s progress to the Celestial City.</p><p>*<em>This sermon was preached and dedicated to the ACS Senior Class of 2020.</em></p>	100	\N	The Young Christian&#8217;s Progress	\N	/matese-fields-pvHma684eEI-unsplash-scaled.jpg
489	2020-04-30 02:58:38	\N	\N	\N	<p>Jehu is an interesting figure in the Bible. He ruled as Israel’s king for 28 years. He is most known for how he became king. When Elijah was in the cave fretting over Jezebel’s letter, the Lord told him that Jehu son of Nimshi would be anointed king of Israel and that he would be an avenger of blood (1 Kings 19:16-17; 2 Kings 9:36-37;10:10). Once Jehu was anointed to become Israel’s next king, it didn’t take him long to begin executing the Lord’s vengeance on Ahab and Jezebel.</p><p>As I read Jehu’s exploits I was reminded of Elijah, Naboth, and the prophets who had been killed. None of them got to see the Lord take vengeance on Ahab and Jezebel. Though those men were gone, God was still working on their behalf. God’s promise that Ahab and Jezebel would pay for their atrocities didn’t have an expiration date. Just because Elijah was no longer on earth, didn’t mean God wouldn’t come through.</p><p>A friend of mine was going through a tough season many years ago facing many adversaries. One morning during prayer the Lord spoke this word to him: “I’ll fight for you, but I won’t fight with you.” In other words, God alone will make vengeance, but He won’t be our accomplice in revenge.</p><p>The apostle Paul, referencing the Lord in Deuteronomy said, “Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord” (Rom. 12:17-19). While we may want to payback those who have wronged us, that is not our place. But make no mistake, when God’s people and His justice has been harmed, vengeance is the Lord’s. Furthermore, the Lord can inflict far more pain than we ever could. But in our attempts for revenge, we harm ourselves far more than we harm others.</p><p>Just remember: God will fight for you, but He won’t fight with you.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 9-11	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-9-11.png
490	2020-04-29 02:16:16	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>The sons of the prophets were staying with Elisha, learning and desiring the instruction of the man of God. The school of the prophets</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>was growing. One of the young prophets went to Elisha and said, “See the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us. Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get a there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” They were growing in number, but the place where they stayed was getting smaller. So this student along with the others wanted to build a bigger building.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He requested of Elisha that they go to the Jordan river and every man grab a log and then build with those logs. Elisha agreed to their request knowing that the place was too small and they needed larger facilities. But as they went to the Jordan there was a young man cutting down a tree and his axe head flew off the handle and into the river. He became distraught for the axe had been borrowed. Chances are he couldn’t afford his own axe, and now it looks as if he would have to replace the axe with money he probably didn&#8217;t have.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most important tool he had was lost. In other words, he lost his edge.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever lost your spiritual edge? It’s easy to do. Life gets busy and you’re unable to sharpen your spiritual perception. Like the young prophet, while you’re swinging away the edge slips from the handle and falls into the depths of life.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Elisha asked the young man, “Where did it fall?” If they could locate the place, then it could be recovered. Ask yourself the question “Where did I lose my spiritual edge?” Did you lose it when you stopped praying? Did it slip away when you began to neglect the Word of God? Did you lose your edge when your church attendance and involvement waned? Any one of these could lead to your spiritual edge being lost.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Elisha took a stick, threw it in the water, and the axe head floated to the surface. Something so ordinary as getting a stick and throwing it in the water supernaturally produced the edge. Perhaps something as ordinary as praying, reading the Bible, and being faithful to God’s house may supernaturally recover your spiritual edge. Go get your edge back!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 6-8	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-2-kings-4-5-1.png
491	2020-04-28 12:43:03	\N	\N	\N	<p>Elisha had come back to Gilgal and it was here that he was teaching the sons of the prophets. Gilgal was east of Jericho close to the Jordan River. Gilgal was a memorable place in the history of Israel. It was here Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground and set up the 12 stones. Here at Gilgal was the place where Israel circumcised the young men who had been born in Egypt and the wilderness. It was at Gilgal that the manna stopped and Israel first ate of the corn of the land. But it was also at Gilgal that Saul disobeyed God by not putting all the Amalakites to death. Unfortunately Gilgal had become a backsliding land filled with apostate Israelites who worshipped false gods and forgot Jehovah. Gilgal was in the midst of a famine. It was geographically close to the Jordan River meaning it should have had some sort of moisture despite a famine. However, this was God’s judgment for Israel’s backsliding.</p><p>Elisha and the prophets became hungry while at Gilgal, which was problematic due to the famine. Elisha had one of the men go get a large pot in order to cook some food. “And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.” Not much grows during a famine, but this man stumbled upon some dangerous ingredients for Elisha’s pottage.</p><p>Once the concoction was ready they began to pour some out for the hungry prophets. As they began to eat they noticed something funny about their stew. Something they tasted opened their senses that something was deadly in the pot.</p><p>Elisha said, “Bring me some flour to throw in the pot!” Somehow Elisha’s ingredient counteracted the deadly herb, and the men were able to continue to eat.</p><p>Have you ever ordered something at a restaurant but wanted the kitchen to exclude some ingredient? Perhaps you’re not a fan of onions, but somehow onions end up in your meal. It’s difficult to get every last bit of onion out. That’s what sin is like. No matter how hard you try, once it’s in your heart you have a difficult time getting it out. There’s only one ingredient that can get the sin out of your life, and that is the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ! But Jesus isn’t an ingredient to add on to your life. No, He replaces everything and makes your life better. The writer said, “Taste and see that the Lord is good.”</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 4-5	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-4-5.png
492	2020-04-27 11:43:20	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>T<em>here was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord</em> (1 Kings 8:9–10).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The building of the Temple was Solomon’s first major task as Israel’s king. Nothing compared with the splendor and beauty of the Temple. Towards the completion of the Temple, Solomon had two pillars for the porch of the Temple made. These two pillars made of brass were 27 feet high, and 18 to 20 feet in circumference. The capitals atop the pillars added another seven feet to their height making them altogether 34 feet high. Those who approached the Temple would be awe-struck at the wonder of the Temple with its bronze pillars.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Two Pillars</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Two symbolic names were given to these pillars. To the right was Jachin, and to the left was Boaz. Jachin means “He will establish” and Boaz means “in Him is strength.” Both of these names were in reference to the Lord. First, He had established Israel as a nation, and confirmed the Davidic covenant through Solomon (2 Sam. 7:8-16). We can conclude that the pillar named Jachin looked back at God’s fulfilled promises. Next, Boaz represented confidence in God that He would continue to work on behalf of Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These pillars are object lessons for the Christian believer. Consider what the apostle Paul said, “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15). The Church is the pillar and ground of truth. The truth of the gospel is held up by the Church. If the Church doesn’t stand for truth, then it will inevitably fall, no matter how beautiful its facade might be.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Jachin and Boaz both represent the work and person of Jesus Christ. Just as Jachin signified God’s fulfilled promises to Israel and David, Jesus has fulfilled all the Old Testament Law (Matt. 5:17-20). Jesus’ fulfillment of the Law establishes a New Covenant through grace. If Jachin is the establishment and fulfillment of promises, then Boaz gives us strength that God is in control of the past, present, and future. In other words, Jesus’ fulfillment of Old Testament promises gives us confidence that He will continue to work on our behalf: “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A church without the pillars of truth is not a church at all, it’s nothing more than a social club built upon opinions and preferences. But the truth that the church is built upon is Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit (Eph. 2:20-21).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me (Jn. 14:6).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’m thankful for the truth that is Jesus Christ!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Ark of the Covenant</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Solomon used the blueprint of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness, and its furnishings for the Temple. The Ark of the Covenant was three and three-fourths feet long, two and one-fourth feet wide, and two and one-fourth feet high. It was made of wood, covered with gold. The Ark contained the written Law of Moses, a pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded. Sitting on top of the ark was the golden Mercy Seat which had two cherubim with their outstretched wings touching.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Ark was a symbol of God’s throne and represented His power, presence, and mercy. On the Day of Atonement, the High Priest would enter this last room and sprinkle blood on the Mercy Seat from the slain sacrifice. The broken law, which was housed in the Ark, needed mercy and shed blood to cover it. But it was here, at the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, that the Shekinah Glory of God would hover. The glory of God would dwell where the shed blood of redemption was applied. The broken law is covered by mercy and blood, because the Spirit of God would not dwell where blood wasn’t applied.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Ark Brought In</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once the entire Temple was built, the priests positioned the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, and upon their exit, the glory of the Lord filled the Temple (1 Kings 8:6-11). This is the moment that the Temple became the House of the Lord. It was no longer just a beautiful edifice built by the hands of men, it was now the dwelling place of the Most High God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, in the church there needs to be truth, but there also must be Spirit. Jesus said, “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth” (Jn. 4:24). The Spirit of God illuminates our inner man that we might behold the Truth of Jesus Christ. Our minds are transformed by truth, and the heart is filled with the Holy Spirit. But truth and Spirit work in tandem- the Holy Spirit teaches and guides us to all Truth (Jn. 14:26; Lk. 12:12; 1 Cor. 2:10-13).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before God’s presence could fill the Temple, the Ark had to be in its rightful place. This same phenomenal event took place at the inauguration of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness (Ex. 40:34-35). Much time had passed since the initial erection of the Tabernacle, and consequently the Ark had moved around quite a bit since the time of Samuel. David, in the interim, had erected a tabernacle-like structure for the Ark to dwell in while he was king of Israel (2 Sam. 6:17). <strong>By the time the Temple had been built there was nothing in the Ark save the two tablets of stone upon which the Law was inscribed (1 Kings 8:9</strong>). Previously, a pot of manna and the staff of Aaron were included in the Ark (Heb. 9:4).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But let’s consider what was missing in the Ark &#8211; the pot of manna and Aaron’s budding rod.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Manna and Aaron&#8217;s Rod<strong><br /></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Israel had been complaining about not having anything to eat in the wilderness, so the Lord gave them manna from heaven (Ex. 16:1-30). A portion of the manna was to be placed in a pot and included in the Ark (Ex. 16:32-33). The pot of manna would serve as a reminder to future generations, when they came to worship, of God’s faithfulness in caring for His people.</p>\r\n<p>In the Old Testament there came a time when the manna ceased to be given (Josh. 5:11-12). When we get to the New Testament, Jesus revealed that He was the True Bread that had come down out of heaven to fulfill humanity’s hunger (Jn. 5:26-51).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Later during Israel’s wandering through the desert, Korah rebelled against the leadership of Moses and Aaron (Num. 16:1-50). After God’s judgment upon Korah, the Lord had Moses take a rod from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Moses was to take those twelve rods and place them in front of the Ark inside the Tabernacle. God said that the rod of the man He had chosen would blossom over night. The next morning Aaron’s rod had not only blossomed, but it had yielded ripe almonds (Num. 17:1-13).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The budding rod indicated that Aaron was God’s choice for the office of High Priest. Following this amazing miracle, Moses was to place Aaron’s rod inside the Ark. Aaron’s rod in the Ark served as a reminder of God’s sovereign choice in leadership, and His judgment upon those who rebelled.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the Aaronic and Levitical priesthood would become obsolete. What’s more, is that Jesus is our chosen High Priest perpetually, and He has taken our judgment upon Himself (Heb. 7-9)! Therefore, Jesus is the fulfillment of the pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While the pot of manna and Aaron’s rod had be removed, all that was left was the Law of God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>The Word Made Flesh<strong><br /></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, do you see the significance of what remained in the Ark? What remained was the Word of God! John recorded in his gospel, that Jesus Christ is the Word of God made flesh (Jn. 1:1-5,14).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth&#8221; (Jn. 1:1-2,14).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus is the sum and substance of the Word of God, revealing God’s will and His very Person. As the glory filled the Temple when the Ark was positioned in its rightful place, Solomon said, “The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness” (1 Kings 8:12). God no longer dwells in a thick darkness, instead He has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away” (Mt. 24:35).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What remains is the Word of God &#8211; which is Jesus Christ!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The manna might have ceased, but Jesus is still the Bread of Life fulfilling life’s greatest hunger. The Aaronic priesthood maybe rendered obsolete, but we have a High Priest that ever remains. And all of it is found in Jesus.</p>\r\n	100	\N	What Remains	\N	/img_2032.jpg
493	2020-04-26 11:44:09	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Lord chose Elisha to be Elijah’s predecessor (1 Kings 20:16, 20-21). Elisha, as an act of servitude, poured water on the hands of Elijah (2 Kings 3:11). Elisha wanted to be just like Elijah. In fact, as the day of Elijah’s departure grew closer, Elisha was right next to him. Also following Elijah on his path to takeoff, were fifty other prophets. Elijah had quite a following. But it was Elisha who would succeed the great man of God.</p><p>Since Elisha persistently kept up with Elijah from Gilgal to Jericho, Elijah asked if he had any requests. Elisha said, “I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me” (2 Kings 2:9). “Thou has asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee” Elijah replied. Soon after Elisha’s request there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven (2 Kings 2:11). Elisha seen this miraculous event take place. But as he stood there gazing up into heaven, he noticed Elijah’s mantle falling from the sky. Elijah had worn that mantle everywhere. Just recently Elijah took that very mantle and smote the Jordan River and it parted so the two of them could crossover (2 Kings 2:8). Elisha picked up that mantle, placed it around his shoulders and went back towards the Jordan River.</p><p>Elisha reached the Jordan River, took off Elijah’s mantle and prayed, “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” Elisha smote the waters and immediately the river parted for Elisha to crossover. God had indeed given Elisha the very same spirit of Elijah.</p><p>This is important for it reveals that God is not limited to time or to individuals. God is not going to be left without a witness. One thinks of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. Doubtless the disciples were troubled at the departure of their Lord. But Jesus had previously told them that the very works that He had done would be accomplished through them as well (Jn. 14:12). However, if they were going to do the same works, and even greater works, they would need to receive His Spirit (Jn. 14:13-17; Acts 1:8-12; 2:1-4).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must have the Spirit of Christ if we are to be like Christ. God is not limited to time or to individuals. What God is looking for is availability.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Kings 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Kings-1-3.png
494	2020-04-25 13:03:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>First Kings chapters 11-16 are some of the bleakest chapters in all of Scripture. Solomon, the world’s wisest man, becomes the world’s greatest fool. Rehoboam splits the kingdom of Israel through sheer youthful stubbornness. Jeroboam becomes king over ten tribes of Israel and yokes the people of Israel to bull worship. Israel’s next kings weren’t much better. Omri is labeled the crown prince of evil. His awfulness is only surpassed by his son, Ahab, who marries a jezebel, orders the rebuilding of Jericho, and continues to lead Israel down the muck and mire pit of Baal worship.</p><h2>Lonely Prophets</h2><blockquote><p>And Elijah the Tishbite, <i>who was</i> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, <i>As</i> the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word (1 Kings 17:1).</p></blockquote><p>Then suddenly from the darkness comes a blazing light. Elijah comes on the stage of Israel’s history like a crash of thunder, only to disappear in a whirlwind. The writer of Kings doesn’t give Elijah an introduction (1 Kings 17:1). Readers are left with a thousand questions. Where did he go to seminary? What is his Twitter handle? How many followers does he have? What books has he written? Does he have a podcast? Is he married? What about children? Who are his friends? What conferences has he preached? How did he meet Ahab? Where did he get that outfit?</p><p>The writer doesn’t give us the answers to the questions we are looking for concerning Elijah. All that’s given is his name, and his hometown. Elijah means “My God is Yahweh.” His hometown of Gilead was located just east of the Jordan River. Gilead was a mountainous and rugged area. The people of Gilead reflected the nature of their environment: they were rough and rugged, solemn and stern, dwelling in rather plain villages and subsisting by keeping flocks of sheep. They were hardened by an open-air life, dressed in a cloaks of camel&#8217;s hair, and accustomed to spending most of their time in solitude. It’s no question as to why Elijah stood out in Israel. He didn’t live, look, or sound like the rest of Israel.</p><p>Why is it important to note the abruptness of Elijah’s ministry? The great movement of evil in Israel made it seem as if darkness would prevail. The majority of people were worshipping Baal, and neglecting the True God. But we must be sure that God, in unexpected places and times, has already secretly prepared a counter-movement. God can raise men and women out of nowhere. Elijah’s life stands out like a diamond laying upon black velvet. But like any diamond, it has to be mined and cut and molded into the dazzling wonder that it is.</p><p>Part of Elijah’s preparation was in the school of loneliness. Elijah might be the loneliest man in Scripture. Unlike other heroes of the Old and New Testaments, Elijah worked alone. He didn’t have the support of a wife, family, friends or associates. He appears and disappears by himself. Elijah was educated in the desert, and discipled in solitude.</p><p>There is no question that many are struggling during this pandemic crisis. For many, the recommendation to stay at home and quarantine is worse than the virus itself. Some are so dependent on being connected to others. Whether physically or digitally, they have to be in constant contact with people. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with that. Even the Lord said, “It’s not good for man to be alone” (Gen. 2:18).</p><p>On the other hand, if a man is to be much <em>for</em> God, then he must be much <em>with</em> God. I’d dare say, during this dark time, God is raising up men and women who will be much <em>for</em> God, because they have spent much time <em>with</em> God.</p><p>Before the rise of digital photos, we developed pictures in the dark. Likewise, the greatest of ministries are those that are developed in the dark. Seasons of lonely prayer, and Bible study in conjunction with periods spent alone with God. That’s what will make ministries great.</p><p>I’ve mentioned it recently, but you shouldn’t waste this moment. We’ve all been given an allotment of time to be much <em>with</em> God. This isn’t a time to waste on the trivialities of social media, television, and a host of other time wasting outlets. If there are going to be some Elijahs in this moment of history, then you need to make sure you’re making most of these moments.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln said, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” Now is the time to be sharpening your axe. Now is the opportunity to be preparing for our greatest moments.</p><p>Elijah appears abruptly, but his ministry had long-term effects. I think of John the Baptist, who came in the spirit of Elijah. Little is known about his short life. How did he get to where he got? He gave his head to Herod, but John had given his heart to Jehovah many years before that.</p><p>We know much of Jesus’ conception and birth. There is, however, very little information given from that time until his ministry. The first thirty years of His life are silent, but the three years of His ministry are history changing.</p><blockquote><p>The point being, is that if you can’t dedicate your life during the silence, then you won’t make a difference in spotlight.</p></blockquote><p>Can your ministry survive without applause? Are you able to continue working for the Lord if no one pats you on the back? Can you lead worship without anyone there? Because that’s what we are having to do during this pandemic.</p><p>We need a generation that can turn off the noise, and have an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the church. I’m not just speaking to those who are tuning in, I’m speaking to myself as well. It’s easy to get distracted, and allow the noise of technology to lure us away from our purpose.</p><h2>Dirty Birds</h2><blockquote><p>And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there (1 Kings 17:1-4)</p></blockquote><p>Elijah points his finger in the face of Ahab, and says, “As the Lord God liveth, before home I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.” Evil has met its match. God’s prophet is ready to have a showdown with Israel’s Baal worshiping king.</p><p>Going back to Deuteronomy 11, the blessing of seasonal rain was dependent upon Israel’s adherence to the Law of Moses. The two seasons of rainfall for Israel was March-April and October-November. The time between was quite dry. Therefore, a prophecy of a draught was troubling to say the least. But Israel’s drought would last three years! Furthermore, it wasn’t just a draught of rain, it was a drought of the Word of God. Elijah wasn’t going to be sticking around Israel. I’m not sure what it worse, the drought of rain, or a drought of the Word of God.</p><p>There has been quite a panic over the last month concerning supplies. Empty shelves and empty cupboards have become unusual for us North Americans.</p><p>But what of our prayer closets? Are they empty too? What about our Bibles? Have they gathered dust while our digital devices have to be charged every two-three hours? We should be concerned if God isn’t speaking during this time.</p><p>The Lord told Elijah to head towards the brook at Cherith near the Jordan. Elijah was to drink from the brook to have his thirst quenched. But the next part is interesting &#8211; “I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.”</p><p>Ravens themselves were considered by the Law of Moses to be unclean (Lev. 11:15; Deut. 14:14). What kind of meat would a dirty bird bring? Don’t ask, just cook it and eat it. I don’t think Elijah desired to consider the raven’s sources.</p><p>Here God commanded a dirty bird to feed his prophet. More times than not we like to put everything through our sanctified filter and examine if something or someone is really qualified what God has called them to do.</p><p>But have you considered, that God can sanctify the dirty birds and use them for His purpose and glory? Let us be reminded that none of us were the spiritual doves hovering over Christ’s sovereign head. No, all of us are just justified and sanctified dirty birds.</p><p>There might be someone listening to this right now and you are wondering if you are even worthy to be used of the Lord. Beloved, if He can command a dirty bird to do His bidding, He can take you from the depths of sin and despair and make you a workable vessel.</p><h1>Hopeless Widows</h1><blockquote><p>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee (1 Kings 17:7-9).</p></blockquote><p>The brook dried up and the ravens moved on. The Lord sent Elijah on his next pit-stop during the drought &#8211; Zaraphath. Like the dirty birds, God has commanded a widow woman to sustain the prophet.</p><p>Now, let’s study this hopeless widow woman a little closer. First, we need to notice where her P.O. Box is located &#8211; Zaraphath. Now, I’ve read this numerous times over the years and missed some key information. Zaraphath was located in the region of Zidon, about 80 miles north of Samaria. This wasn’t Israelite country. Let’s see who’s in charge in Zarapheth in Zidon.</p><p>And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him (1 Kings 16:31).</p><p>Elijah had pointed his finger in the face of Ahab, king of Israel, who was married to Jezebel, princess of Zidon. Jezebel’s daddy was Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians.</p><p>Now, the Lord told Elijah to go to Zaraphath, which is located in Zidon, and find a widow woman there. So Elijah is headed to Paganville in Heathenland to be fed by a widow woman. Additionally, the king’s daughter would like nothing more than to have Elijah’s head on a raven-shaped platter.</p><p>Furthermore, “widow” and “sustain” probably sounded just as bizarre as dirty birds working for DoorDash. Widows, at that time, meant someone was in dire poverty. A widow in Old Testament times didn’t attend night school, learn how to code, haver her own YouTube channel, nor starred in sitcom living with her childhood best friend and sister raising her kids. Widowhood was usually a woman with dirt under her fingernails from scratching out the scantest of livings.</p><p>If one could chose, dirty birds sounded more dependable than a hopeless widow. Nevertheless, Elijah traveled to Zaraphath.</p><p>Let us see another picture of grace in this beautiful chapter in First Kings.</p><p>We should see that this widow’s god had left her in a pit of hopelessness. Yet, God has come to her doorstep to press her into His service. Don’t think for one moment that God doesn’t care, and doesn’t know where you are. There might be some who have felt forgotten during this time. But God might be sending a prophet to your door for such a time as this.</p><p>Here is a gentile woman living in the midst of a godless society, and the God of all creation has chosen her. Here is grace that moves beyond the boundaries of Israel, God’s covenant people, and embraces one of Baal’s most hopeless victims. We know her address, but don’t know her name. Yet this nameless widow joins the litany of Old Testament gentiles who were included in the inner circle of grace. One thinks of Jethro (Ex.18); Rahab (Josh. 2,6); Ruth, and Naaman (2 Kings 5). What happens at the house of a hopeless widow in Zaraphath is but a glimpse of that day when God would grant ‘even to the gentiles repentance that leads to life’ (Acts 11:18).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>What can God do with a lonely prophet, dirty birds, and a hopeless widow? Anything. Who else but God would ever design to use a lonely prophet, dirty birds, and a hopeless widow? Who am I to object that God would commission these into His service?</p><p>What of this moment in history? Could God use a global pandemic to fulfill His will? Could God be adopting this moment to awaken prophets? Could God be using this period to call and sanctify some dirty birds? Is this crisis being used of God to minister to the hopeless who feel forgotten?</p>	100	\N	Lonely Prophets, Dirty Birds, and Hopeless Widows	\N	/ravens.jpg
495	2020-04-24 16:00:17	\N	\N	\N	<p>Ahab, apparently, had built for himself a second home in Jezreel (1 Kings 18:45-46). Jezreel is located north of Israel’s capital in Samaria. This geographical location is very fertile and plush. It’s made up with vineyards, which produce grapes for wine production, and the rocky areas serve as winepresses. Vineyards were very precious to Israel and Scripture is replete with references to vineyards, grapes and wine.</p><p>Naboth inherited a vineyard located near Ahab’s palace (1 Kings 21:1). Ahab had an offer for Naboth: “Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money” (1 Kings 21:2). Ahab wanted to either make a trade for Naboth’s vineyard, or buy it outright.</p><p>Notice that Ahab wanted to turn Naboth’s vineyard into a garden of herbs (21:2a). The Hebrew phrase for “garden of herbs” is only found in two places in Scripture, here in 1 Kings 21, and in Deuteronomy 11:10. Deuteronomy 11:10 states: “For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs.” The land of Canaan wasn’t like Egypt. On the contrary, Canaan was a land of hills and valleys, a land which the Lord cared for (Deut. 11:11-12). But that’s not what Ahab wanted. He desired to uproot Naboth’s vineyard and replace it with what Egypt produced.</p><p>Naboth said, “The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee” (1 Kings 21:3). Naboth wasn’t about to sell or trade his vineyard. According to the Law of Moses, Naboth wasn’t in any need to sell it (Lev. 25:23-28; Num. 36:7-9). That vineyard was precious to Naboth. It had been passed down to him from his ancestors, and if things went as planned, he would give it to his sons. Ahab may have been able to give him a larger, more fertile vineyard, but in Naboth’s mind there wasn’t a better vineyard than the one he received from his family.</p><p>Ahab went home dejected. Here was a man who had everything as a king, but couldn’t have one vineyard. Jezebel, Ahab’s Phoenician wife, wasn’t hearing of it. “No king should have to submit to any law! And nobody should refuse a king’s offer.” If Naboth wasn’t willing to make a deal, then Jezebel would take the vineyard by force. She concocted a plan and had Naboth and his sons killed (1 Kings 21:4-15). And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it (1 Kings 21:16).</p><p>What can we take away from this biblical narrative? First, we must be committed to what we have been given. The apostle Paul wrote, “Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you&#8211;guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us” (2 Tim. 1:14 NIV). We are to guard the truth of God’s Word which has been entrusted to us. Furthermore, we are to commit what we have been given to others (2 Tim. 2:2). Second, we have to be willing have faith in the midst of apostasy. Naboth was committed, but he was also courageous. It will never be easy to stand for what you believe in the face of pressure.</p><p>To Naboth there was nothing more precious than what he had been given. Beloved, let us never trade or sell what we have been given through Jesus Christ. It is more precious than silver and gold.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 21-22	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-21-22.png
496	2020-04-24 02:17:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>First Kings chapters 11-16 are some of the darkest times in Israel’s history. Then suddenly from the darkness there comes a blazing light. Elijah appears on the stage of Israel’s history like a crash of thunder, and disappears in a whirlwind. The writer of Kings doesn’t give Elijah much of an introduction. Readers are left with a thousand questions. Who are Elijah’s parents? What did he do for a living in Gilead? Where did he go to seminary? What is his Twitter handle? How many followers does he have? What books has he written? Does he have a podcast? Is he married? What about children? Who are his friends? What conferences has he preached? How did he meet Ahab? Where did he get that outfit?</p><p>The writer doesn’t give answers to the questions readers might be asking. All that’s given is his name, and his hometown. Elijah’s name means “My God is Yahweh.” His hometown of Gilead was located just east of the Jordan River. Gilead was a rugged and mountainous area. The people of Gilead reflected the nature of their country. They were rough and rugged, solemn and stern, dwelling in rather plain villages and managing to get by with shepherding. They were hardened by an open-air life, dressed in a cloaks of camel&#8217;s hair, and accustomed to spending most of their time in solitude. It’s no question as to why Elijah stood out in Israel. He didn’t live, look, or sound like the rest of Israelite culture.</p><p>Why is it important to note the abruptness of Elijah’s ministry? The great movement of evil in Israel made it seem as if darkness would prevail. The majority of people were worshipping Baal, and neglecting the True God. But we must be sure that God, in unexpected places and times, has already secretly prepared a counter-movement. God can raise men and women out of nowhere. Elijah’s life stands out like a diamond laying upon black velvet. But like any diamond, it has to be mined, cut, and molded into the dazzling wonder that it is. Keeping with this analogy, God shaped a prophet to stand out in Israel’s bleakest of moments.</p><p>Part of Elijah’s preparation was in the school of loneliness. Elijah might be the loneliest man in Scripture. Unlike other heroes of the Old and New Testaments, Elijah worked alone. He didn’t have the support of a wife, family, friends or associates. He appears and disappears by himself. Elijah was educated in the desert, and discipled in solitude.</p><p>There is no question that many are struggling during this pandemic crisis. For many, the recommendation to stay at home and quarantine is worse than the virus itself. Some are dependent on being connected to others. Whether physically or digitally, they have to be in constant contact with people. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with that. Even the Lord said, “It’s not good for man to be alone” (Gen. 2:18).</p><p>On the other hand, if a man is to be much for God, then he must be much with God. I’d dare say, during this dark time, God is raising up men and women who will be much for God, because they have spent much time with God. Before the rise of digital photos, we developed pictures in the dark. Likewise, the greatest of ministries are those that are developed in the dark. Seasons of lonely prayer, and study time in conjunction with periods spent alone with God.</p><p>I’m reminded of an old chorus, “Shut in with God in a secret place. There in the spirit, beholding His face gaining new power to run in this race. Oh, I love to be shut in with God.” Beloved, let us never be afraid to be alone with God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 17-20	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-17-20.png
497	2020-04-23 01:36:58	\N	\N	\N	<p>Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom, known as Israel, consisted of ten of the twelve tribes. The southern kingdom, known as Judah, consisted of Judah and what was left of Benjamin. Israel’s capital became Samaria, and Judah’s capital became Jerusalem. This will be important information moving forward in our reading of the Old Testament, especially for the rest of Kings and Chronicles. Furthermore, as we will see, Israel never again enjoyed godly leadership. Judah, on the other hand, had a few godly men lead their portion of the kingdom.</p><p>Israel’s worst king was a man by the name of Ahab, and that’s saying something. We just read a few chapters previously how Jeroboam did quite a number on Israel’s spiritual health. The writer of 1 Kings says, “And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him” (1 Kings 16:30–31). Did you catch that? Ahab did evil in the sight of the Lord above all who were before him. Jeroboam, remember, had the people to worship bulls. Omri, Ahab’s father, had just been labeled the crown prince of evil (16:25). Now Ahab was considered worse than all of them put together!</p><p>The writer, in his introduction to Ahab, gives us a glimpse into his evil regime. Under Ahab’s direction, Hiel the Bethlehemite, built Jericho. This isn’t just some random act of improving past infrastructure. The writer even explains the history of the matter: “In Ahab&#8217;s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken by Joshua son of Nun” (1 Kings 16:34 NIV). After the destruction of Jericho Joshua pronounced a curse upon anyone who would attempt to rebuild Jericho (Josh. 6:26). Joshua said the man who would lay again Jericho’s foundation would lose his firstborn. Moreover, if they rebuilt the gates of Jericho, he would lose his youngest son. That is exactly what happened to Hiel. He relaid Jericho’s foundation and his firstborn son died. As if that wasn’t bad enough he rebuilt the city’s gates which was followed by the death of his youngest son.</p><p>How do we know Ahab was more evil than all previous kings? He openly defied God’s Word. He dared to rebuild what God had previously torn down. Keep in mind, dear reader, this isn’t some random king from another nation rebuilding Jericho. This is Israel’s king, and this is God’s chosen people. This was the offspring of the people who marched around Jericho, and shouted as the walls fell at their feet. It was Ahab and Hiel’s ancestors who had witnessed the possession of the Promised Land. And now look at them. They were relinquishing everything that God had given them.</p><p>Beloved, it’s dangerous territory to rebuild things that God has torn down in our lives. It’s just as dangerous to go back and rebuild things that God tore down in previous generations. Because it won’t just be the present generation that suffers, but it will be future generations that are buried beneath the rubble.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 14-16	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-14-16.png
498	2020-04-22 02:06:05	\N	\N	\N	<p>Solomon turned his heart away from the Lord and towards a myriad of strange women and their gods (1 Kings 11:1-6). The Lord promised, due to Solomon’s backsliding, that He would rend the kingdom of Israel from Solomon’s successor. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, made some unwise decisions concerning the treatment of God’s people (1 Kings 12:1-19). Ten tribes broke away from Rehoboam and followed after Jeroboam. Jeroboam was an industrious mighty man of valor. Solomon had made him ruler over the house of Joseph (1 Kings 11:28). Though he wasn’t offspring of David, he became Israel’s new king. Rehoboam remained king over Judah and a small population of Benjamin.</p><p>The Temple, and therefore worship, remained in Jerusalem located in Judah. Jeroboam was worried that if people traveled to Jerusalem to worship, then their allegiance would return to Rehoboam (1 Kings 12:26-27). In order to keep his fears from coming true, he decided to set up two alternative places of worship. Jeroboam set up a bull to worship in Dan, and another in Bethel. Yes, you read that correctly. Jeroboam made two bulls to be worshiped. To make matters worse, he built high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi (1 Kings 13:28-31). He didn’t stop there. Next, he ordained a holy day, to look like the other holy days in Judah. But what is the use of idols, houses of worship, and priests without an altar (1 Kings 13:32-33)?</p><p>Israel’s greatest threat wasn’t a nation, a people, or a person. Israel’s greatest threat was false doctrine. The Lord warned His people time and again to avoid the worship of false gods, and any imitation of true worship (Ex. 20:3; Deut. 8:19-20). Jeroboam, Israel’s king, had officially lead God’s chosen people to worship bulls.</p><p>The threat of false doctrine wasn’t limited to the Old Testament. In the New Testament we see warnings against anything that would corrupt true devotion to Christ. The apostle Paul warned the newly formed Ephesian church at his departure: “For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them” (Acts 20:28-29).<br />Jeroboam offered Israel a new religion. It looked and sounded a lot like what they experienced previously. But if they would have looked a little closer, they would have realized they had been deceived.</p><p>It is imperative, beloved, that we know how to discern between true and false doctrine.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 12-13	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-12-13.png
499	2020-04-21 01:36:49	\N	\N	\N	<p>Solomon’s wisdom and kingdom attracted many visitors. Scripture records the queen of Sheba being one of those visitors. “And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions” (1 Kings 10:1). It wasn’t just Solomon that intrigued her, but it was also the name of the Lord she wanted to know more about.</p><p>Sheba, located in southwest Arabia, was a wealthy land known for its famous spice production. Accordingly, the queen didn’t arrive empty handed, she came bearing expensive gifts for Solomon. She and her country may have wanted to do business with Solomon and Israel, but the queen desired something far greater than a trade agreement. She had questions, and wanted to share with Solomon all that was in her heart (1 Kings 10:2).</p><p>Solomon gave the distinguished guest a tour of Jerusalem. She was impressed with Temple, the king’s palace, and the kingdom’s servants. Furthermore, Solomon answered her hard questions, and revealed the secrets of her heart (1 Kings 10:3). It is said of the queen, “there was no more spirit in her” (1 Kings 10:5). The queen said, “It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard” (1 Kings 10:6-7).</p><p>The queen had heard the reports concerning the king of Israel. But she believed them not. It wasn’t until she came to know the king, and seen for herself the wonder of the kingdom, that she believed. What she had simply heard from the mouths of others was but half of what she truly experienced on her own.</p><p>Do you remember when you first met King Jesus? You had heard the reports of deliverance, healing and salvation, but you didn’t believe it. It wasn’t until you came to know Him for yourself that you realized that the half hadn’t been told! It was so much that there was no more spirit in you. The King revealed the secrets of your heart, and He loved you in spite of that. In turn, He gave you a new heart and put within you a new Spirit.</p><p>I think of that old Andrae Crouch song that said, “Somebody told me of the joy they had. And somebody told me that in sorrow they could be glad. Then they told me once they were bound but now set free. But I didn&#8217;t think it could be until it happened to me.”</p><p>Beloved, you’ll never know that it’s true until it happens to you.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 10-11	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-10-11.png
500	2020-04-20 00:08:52	\N	\N	\N	<p>The priests positioned the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, and upon their exit, the glory of the Lord filled the Temple (1 Kings 8:6-11). This is the moment that the Temple became the House of the Lord. It was no longer just a beautiful edifice built by the hands of men, it was now the dwelling place of the Most High God.</p><p>The Ark represented God’s power, presence, and mercy. Before God’s presence could fill the Temple, the Ark had to be in its rightful place. This same phenomenal event took place at the inauguration of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness (Ex. 40:34-35). Much time had passed since the initial erection of the Tabernacle, and consequently the Ark had moved around quite a bit since the time of Samuel. David, in the interim, had erected a tabernacle-like structure for the Ark to dwell in while he was king of Israel (2 Sam. 6:17). By the time the Temple had been built there was nothing in the Ark save the two tablets of stone upon which the Law was inscribed (1 Kings 8:9). Previously, a pot of manna and the staff of Aaron were included in the Ark (Heb. 9:4). But let’s consider what was missing in the Ark &#8211; the pot of manna and Aaron’s budding rod.</p><p>Israel had been complaining about not having anything to eat in the wilderness, so the Lord gave them manna from heaven (Ex. 16:1-30). A portion of the manna was to be placed in a pot and included in the Ark (Ex. 16:32-33). The pot of manna would serve as a reminder to future generations, when they came to worship, of God’s faithfulness in caring for His people.</p><p>Later during Israel’s wandering through the desert, Korah rebelled against the leadership of Moses and Aaron (Num. 16:1-50). After God’s judgment upon Korah, the Lord had Moses take a rod from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Moses was to take those twelve rods and place them in front of the Ark inside the Tabernacle. God said that the rod of the man He had chosen would blossom over night. The next morning Aaron’s rod had not only blossomed, but it had yielded ripe almonds (Num. 17:1-13). The budding rod indicated that Aaron was God’s choice for the office of High Priest. Following this amazing miracle, Moses was to place Aaron’s rod inside the Ark. Aaron’s rod in the Ark served as a reminder of God’s sovereign choice in leadership, and His judgment upon those who rebelled.</p><p>In the Old Testament there came a time when the manna ceased to be given (Josh. 5:11-12). When we get to the New Testament, Jesus is the True Bread that has come down out of heaven to fulfill humanity’s hunger (Jn. 5:26-51). Moreover, the Aaronic and Levitical priesthood would become obsolete. What’s more, is that Jesus is our chosen High Priest perpetually, and He has taken our judgment upon Himself (Heb. 7-9)! Therefore, Jesus is the fulfillment of the pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded.</p><p>Beloved, do you see the significance of what remained in the Ark? What remained was the Word of God! John recorded in his gospel, that Jesus Christ is the Word of God made flesh (Jn. 1:1-5,14). He is the sum and substance of the Word of God, revealing God’s will and His very Person. As the glory filled the Temple when the Ark was positioned in its rightful place, Solomon said, “The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness” (1 Kings 8:12). God no longer dwells in a thick darkness, instead He has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 4:6).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 8-9	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-8-9.png
501	2020-04-18 15:34:49	\N	\N	\N	<p>The building of the Temple was Solomon’s first major task as Israel’s king. Nothing compared with the splendor and beauty of the Temple. Towards the completion of the Temple, Solomon had two pillars for the porch of the Temple made. These two pillars made of brass were 27 feet high, and 18 to 20 feet in circumference. The capitals atop the pillars added another seven feet to their height making them altogether 34 feet high. Those who approached the Temple would be awe-struck at the wonder of the Temple with its brass pillars.</p><p>Two symbolic names were given to these pillars. To the right was Jachin, and to the left was Boaz. Jachin means “He will establish” and Boaz means “in Him is strength.” Both of these names were in reference to the Lord. First, He had established Israel as a nation, and confirmed the Davidic covenant through Solomon (2 Sam. 7:8-16). We can conclude that the pillar named Jachin looked back at God’s fulfilled promises. Next, Boaz represented confidence in God that He would continue to work on behalf of Israel.</p><p>These pillars are object lessons for the Christian believer. Consider what the apostle Paul said, “But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15). The Church is the pillar and ground of truth. The truth of the gospel is held up by the Church. If the Church doesn’t stand for truth, then it will inevitably fall, no matter how beautiful its facade might be.</p><p>Furthermore, Jachin and Boaz both represent the work and person of Jesus Christ. Just as Jachin signified God’s fulfilled promises to Israel and David, Jesus has fulfilled all the Old Testament Law (Matt. 5:17-20). Jesus’ fulfillment of the Law establishes a New Covenant through grace. If Jachin is the establishment and fulfillment of promises, then Boaz gives us strength that God is in control of the past, present, and future. In other words, Jesus’ fulfillment of Old Testament promises gives us confidence that He will continue to work on our behalf: “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 6-7	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-6-7.png

503	2020-04-17 01:59:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>Solomon prayed and asked God for an “understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad” (1 Kings 3:8). The Lord answered Solomon’s request because he did not ask for long life, nor for riches, nor for the life of his enemies. So in 1 Kings 3:16-27 we read the first example of Solomon’s great wisdom.</p><p>Scripture describes these two women as prostitutes. How tragic to be marked and described by past choices and lifestyles. Despite their backgrounds and lifestyles they were given a gift that they were undeserving of: “for children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward” (Ps. 127:3). Indeed, children are a gift of the Lord. Giving birth represents new life and a new beginning. You and I are much like these two women. We were marked with past lifestyles of ungodliness. We weren’t angels when the Lord found us, but somewhere along life’s journey He called us out of darkness, and into His marvelous light! And like these two women, we were given something that we didn’t deserve &#8211; new life.</p><p>Unfortunately one of the women rolled over on her new baby and suffocated it. She awoke to find that she had killed her new baby and before the other mother awoke she switched babies. The other mother awoke to find that her baby was gone and had been switched with a dead baby. She immediately went to King Solomon to seek his wisdom. It would be wise if we went to the King of Kings with our problems before we went to social media or to others who don’t have the ability to help us!</p><p>“Get me a sword” that was Solomon’s first words after he heard the complaints from the mothers. He followed that up with, “Now, let’s cut the baby in half. Each mother will get one half apiece.” You could hear the crowd gasp from Dan to Beersheba.</p><p>The mother of the dead child shrugged her shoulders as if to say “That seems fair.” The mother of the living child, however, cried out, “No! I will not let you cut that baby in half. Give her the baby! Half isn’t good enough for me!” For that mother it was all or nothing. She knew the baby would die if it was cut in half.</p><p>Solomon sat back on his throne and grinned from ear to ear. “Give her the child. She’s the true mother. She would never let her child be cut in half. Because half is never good enough.”</p><p>There are too many Christians who settle for half. They aren’t cold, and they aren’t hot. They are lukewarm. They have one foot in the church and the other in the world. They try to hold hands with Jesus and the devil. But attempts to do so are futile. If you try to live halfway as a Christian, you’re going to end up with a dead form of Christianity.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 3-5	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-3-5.png
504	2020-04-16 01:27:33	\N	\N	\N	<p>Before David’s death, he proclaimed that Solomon would be Israel’s next king. Of course, that didn’t come about without some family turmoil (1 Kings 1). David wanted to insure Israel’s future with Solomon at the helm. The security of the kingdom was bound up in Solomon’s obedience to the Law of Moses (1 Kings 2:1-4). In other words, God would bless Israel, as long as her king walked in step with God.</p><p>Countries and nations would be in a lot better shape if their leaders adhered to God’s laws. Churches and ministries would be a lot more successful in reaching their Kingdom potential if they would listen to and obey God’s Word. Likewise, Christians would be a lot happier if they allowed the Word of God to guide their lives.</p><p>Notice that David uses six words to describe God’s Word: His charge, His ways, His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies (1:3). What was Solomon to obey? All of God’s Word. There wasn’t one thing that Solomon was to neglect or overlook.</p><p>The apostle Paul wrote, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works” (2 Tim. 3:16-17). God has inspired all of Scripture. Paul wrote elsewhere: “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope” (Rom. 15:4). Therefore, all of Scripture is profitable for teaching, reproving, correcting, instructing, and learning. And the outcome of all of these is patience, comfort, and hope!</p><p>Beloved, there are bountiful blessings in the Word of God! Let us not just be hearers of His Word, but let us be doers of His Word!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Kings 1-2	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Kings-1-2.png
505	2020-04-15 01:07:17	\N	\N	\N	<p>There may not be another character in the Bible quite as intriguing as David. I would dare say that in all of Scripture there wasn’t anyone as gifted as David. Many who know anything about David would automatically mention his victory over Goliath or his sin with Bathsheba. However, there is much more to the life and story of David.</p><p>I want us to notice these words concerning David: “Now these are the last words of David: The oracle of the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel” (2 Samuel 23:1). David was the son of Jesse, raised up on high, favored and anointed of God. Finally, he was the sweet psalmist of Israel.</p><p>Notice that his illustrious life doesn’t include his extraordinary exploits and endeavors. There isn’t a mention of killing lions, bears and giants. Nothing is written concerning his leadership of a nation, or the reign of his throne. But I want us to notice what was said about David: he was the sweet psalmist of Israel. These last words of David found in 2 Samuel 22 and 23 are a song. David wanted to be remembered as a psalmist, one who had a song in his heart, and praise on his lips. He didn’t want to be remembered as a giant killer, instead he wanted to be remembered as a worshiper.</p><p>The greatest service that David wrought for Israel was not on the battlefield, in the strategy room, or the throne room. David’s greatest service were the psalms he wrote. He wrote at least seventy-five of the psalms found in the Bible. In the New Testament there at least sixty-nine references to the Book of Psalms.</p><p>Before David killed a giant, or wore a crown upon his head he was found with a harp in his hand. Before David carried a sling or a sword, he learned how to carry a tune. For instance, when an evil spirit tormented King Saul they would call for David to come play for him (1 Sam. 16:17-18). David played his harp and sang his songs to a troubled soul. As David played before the Lord, the evil spirits began to depart. Beloved, there’s more power in your praise and worship than a thousand swords.</p><p>David didn’t leave behind a manual on how to handle a sling, wield a sword, or hold a shield. David didn’t leave behind book on how to lead a winning army. David didn’t write a bestselling book on how to be a successful king and leader. What David left behind was a way to be worshiper, no matter the season of life that you are in. David left behind seventy-five songs of worship. In other words, he left behind a legacy of worship.</p><p>We may not accomplish much in the secular world. We may not be immortalized in the annals of history. But we can be remembered as worshipers. What could be better than that?</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 22-24	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Samuel-22-24.png
506	2020-04-14 01:18:03	\N	\N	\N	<p>Excuses are like armpits, everybody’s got them and they usually stink. Bishop Billy McCool has said, “Those who want to work for the Lord will find a way. Those who don’t will find an excuse.”</p><p>Excuses are what we find in 2 Samuel 19:31-40. We read of a man by the name of Barzillai. We first meet this easily overlooked character in 2 Samuel 17:27-29. He, along with a few others, supported David while Absalom was staging a revolt in Israel. The majority of Israel may have been seduced by Absalom’s stunning good looks and charisma, but Barzillai remained loyal to David. Barzillai and his cohorts provided for David while he was a refuge in Mahanaim.</p><p>It wasn’t long until Absalom was killed and the kingdom was restored to order. The only thing left to do was bringing David back to his rightful throne in Jerusalem. There were many who met David on his return: Shimei, who threw rocks at David as he fled from Jerusalem (2 Sam. 19:16-23); Mephibosheth, the crippled son of Jonathan (2 Sam. 19:24-30); and Barzillai (2 Sam. 18:31-40).</p><p>David asked the eighty year old Barzillai to accompany him back to Jerusalem: “Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem” (2 Sam. 19:33). The king simply wanted Barzillai’s company. But David was met with numerous excuses as to why Barzillai couldn’t go to Jerusalem. First, Barzillai said he was too old to go (19:34-35a). Next, he gave a barrage of phantom inadequacies: can’t discern, can’t taste, and can’t hear (19:35b). He follows that with a presumption: “I’ll be a burden to you” (19:35c).</p><p>But it’s the last excuse that’s really troubling: “Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king. Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother” (2 Sam. 19:36-37). In Barzillai’s estimation, it was just too far to journey with King David back to Jerusalem. He’d rather go back to the same old life and eventually be buried with his parents.</p><p>Like Barzillai, there are too many satisfied with doing the same old thing. They are afraid of trying anything new, or fearful of any change to their life. Then there are those who have no hope beyond the grave. It’s eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Others will go a little way with Christ, but just not too far in fear of being labeled a fanatic.</p><p>Beloved, let us go further with King Jesus. All He wants is our company at His table. We used to sing a song that said, “Come and dine, the Master calleth, come and dine.” You can come eat at Jesus’ table all the time, but you’ll have to leave all of your excuses far behind.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 19-21	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Samuel-19-21.png
507	2020-04-12 23:57:53	\N	\N	\N	<p>Absalom was the third son born to King David. He was of royal descent on both sides of his family. His mother, Maacah, was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur. Not only was he privileged royalty, he was also blessed with good looks: “But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him” (2 Sam. 14:25). Absalom had a commanding presence and a natural beauty. His charm and smooth words would woo the hearts of Israel (2 Sam. 15:1-6). Perhaps they thought him to be a God-sent champion who could eventually fill the shoes of David, his father. This young man had the world at his fingertips. Absalom could have been a hero in Israel, and went down in infamy.</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. Absalom’s anger concerning Amnon’s treatment of his sister Tamar, and David’s lack of disciplinary measures, led to his eventual revolt against his father’s kingdom and the murder of Amnon (2 Sam. 13:20-39).</p><p>Prior to Absalom’s rebellion, he built for himself a pillar in the king’s dale (2 Sam. 18:18). It could have been the place where they would have laid the future hero of Israel. That marble mausoleum could have held that flawless, unblemished body. But that pillar would be empty in just a few short years. It would be a tomb without a tenet. It could have been a pillar and resting place that could have been celebrated by generations of Israelites. But instead Absalom’s body was buried beneath a stone pile (2 Sam. 18:17-18). Like a dead dog, buried in the forest, he would be forgotten when he could have been remembered.</p><p>Absalom’s empty tomb, which is still erect in Israel to this day, represents what could have been. However, there is another tomb that stands empty in the Bible. It is the empty tomb of Jesus Christ, the true son of David.</p><p>The first tomb speaks of a wasted life. The second tomb speaks of victory and a glorious completed work. The tomb of Absalom speaks of failure and disappointment that wasn’t built on God. The tomb of Jesus speaks of life that lives forever because it lives unto God. The empty tomb of Jesus displays redemption and the forgiveness of sins.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Samuel-16-18.png
508	2020-04-12 01:49:39	\N	\N	\N	<p>Friends are found throughout the Bible. Job had friends, but they were miserable companions. Abraham was called God’s friend. Jonathan and David were the best of friends (1 Sam 18:1). The Bible makes many references to friends. How to make them, how to keep them and even how to offend them (Pro. 17:17; 18:24; 27:9,14,19).</p><p>“But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man” (2 Sam. 13:3). Many have stained their souls and come to ruin because they had the wrong kind of friend. Written on Amnon’s tombstone was the epitaph “Amnon had a friend.” Just replace the name Amnon with that of another person you know who had a friend that caused them great trouble.</p><p>Amnon was vexed by his affection with his half-sister, Tamar. The word “vexed” in the Hebrew means to be bound up, cramped, to bring trouble, oppression and distressed. This does not sound like love. Love is not troubling, or oppressive. Amnon was not in love with Tamar. No, he was in lust with Tamar. Love has slain its thousands, but lust has slain its tens of thousands.</p><p>Amnon’s friend gave him the worst of advice. Scripture says that it seemed impossible for Amnon to do anything to Tamar (2 Sam. 13:2). What little bit of conscience Amnon had left was about to be drowned out by Jonadab’s advice. Jonadab said, “You’re the king’s son. Do what you want! Pretend that you’re sick, have Tamar come to your room to care for you, then have your way with her.” That’s exactly what Amnon did. The next several chapters of Second Samuel record the terrible events that take place all because Amnon listened to his friend, instead of his conscience.</p><p>The old saying goes “Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.” If you have the type of friends who only get you into trouble, then it might do you some good to rid yourself of those people, because they aren’t your friends, but your foes.</p><p>Amnon needed a friend like Jesus. He is a Friend who will not tempt you to do things contrary to the will of God. He is a Friend that sticks closer than a brother (Pro. 18:24). He is the best Friend any man or woman could have. He’ll never leave you nor forsake you. He always listens when you talk. Oh, what a Friend we have in Jesus. That’s the type of friend Amnon needed, and the type of friend you and I need.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 13-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Samuel-13-15.png
509	2020-04-11 01:50:46	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>David had been installed and anointed king of Israel, and insisted on showing kindness to someone in Saul’s family. Saul had rebelled against God and eventually was killed in battle along with some of his sons, which included David’s closest friend, Jonathan. David made a covenant with Jonathan to take care of his family once David became king (1 Sam. 20:14).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jonathan had a son by the name of Mephibosheth who was five years old and being taken care of by a nurse while his father and grandfather were out to battle. When word reached the nurse that Jonathan had been killed in battle she left in haste and accidentally dropped Mephibosheth leaving him crippled in both of his feet (2 Samuel 4:4).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David uses the word “kindness” three times in this episode (2 Sam. 8:1, 3, 7). The word “kindness” translated in English doesn’t carry the same weight and significance as the original Hebrew word. The Hebrew word for “kindness” (hesed) means, grace, mercy, loyalty, goodness, faithfulness, and love. Grace is a demonstration of love that is undeserved, unearned, and un-repayable. Grace isn’t picky, and despite Mephibosheth’s disability, David loved him anyway. This is what God did for you and me. Jesus gave what we did not deserve when we were sinfully crippled by our sin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mephibosheth mirrors the condition of every poor, lost, fallen child of Adam&#8217;s ruined race &#8211; cut off by birth, nature, and practice from the presence of God and the table of the King. In David&#8217;s care of Mephibosheth, we begin to see God&#8217;s care for us. He was crippled by a fall. Likewise, men and women are crippled with sin due to the fall of Adam in the Garden. Christ looked for someone to extend grace to, and found us in our broken condition.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mephibosheth had the privilege of sitting at the king’s table for the rest of his life. The apostle Paul said, “But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus” (Eph. 2:4-7).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 8-12	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-2-samuel-1-3-2.png
510	2020-04-10 01:54:26	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>One of the first things David wanted to do when he became Israel’s king was to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. For twenty years the Ark was in the house of Abinadab under the care of his son Eleazar. The Ark had been hijacked by the Philistines during a battle with Israel (1 Sam. 5). They attempted to return it when they were cursed with plagues (1 Sam. 6). In their efforts to return they Ark, they put the ark on a cart and was sent away to Kirjath-jearim (1 Sam. 6:21-7:2).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David attempted to bring the Ark to Jerusalem the same way the Philistines had tried. He put it on a cart with some oxen and tried to bring it home. As the Ark teetered upon the cart, Uzziah reached out and touched it, and he was immediately killed (2 Sam. 6:1-9). No matter how innocent Uzziah’s intentions, touching the Ark was a direct violation of God’s Law (Num. 4:15). Why did it work for the Philistines and not for David? The Philistines didn’t know any better. But David and Israel? They had been taught there was a specific way to move the Ark, and that was upon the shoulders of the Levites (Ex. 25:14-15; Num. 4:15; 7:9; Deut. 10:8; 31:9; Josh. 3:15).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Afraid of the Lord, David was unwilling to move the Ark. So David took the Ark to the house of Obed-Edom. The Ark remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months, and the Lord blessed him and his household (2 Sam. 6:10-11).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your doorbell rings. In anticipation you jump up from your couch. You peek through the peephole, or try to look through the blinds trying to see who it is. If it’s a salesman, you don’t answer. If it’s family or friends you hurriedly compose yourself and answer the door. I cannot imagine what went through Obed-Edom’s mind when he seen King David at his door with the Ark of the Covenant behind him. I bet David said something like, “Hey, Obed. I was wondering if you would do me a solid. I’ve got the Ark of the Lord with me, and I’m needing you to stash it in your spare bedroom for a little while. Oh, and don’t touch it. We are on our way to bury Uzzah, because he reached out and touched it. Thanks!”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Obed-Edom pulls the Ark into his house, and his wife is worried with the thought of having the Presence of Almighty God in her home. This is no ordinary guest! There was still blood stains on the Ark from the Day of Atonement. Inside the Ark was the pot of manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of stone which were engraved with the Law of God. This was the very Ark the Priests carried while the Jordan parted. Furthermore, the Philistines were struck with painful sores when they tried to open the Ark. Poor Uzzah was killed simply trying to keep it from falling. And now Obed-Edom’s wife was going to have to try to clean her house without touching it. The fear of the Lord was put into their children in attempt to keep them from climbing on it, or trying to build a fort with it. I would dare say that Obed-Edom and his family were always aware of God’s Presence while the Ark was in their home.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Their home was to be the place where the Presence of God would dwell. Not the Tabernacle, or the Temple. For three months the Ark would be in their home. During that time the Ark was in their home, they were blessed. No death or sores, but blessings. Because it’s all in how you treat the Presence of God. You cannot be flippant with the Presence of God. Obed-Edom and his family lovingly welcomed the Ark into their home, and because of that they were blessed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some are too uncomfortable with the Presence of God in their home. It causes them to be sore, they don’t like anyone trying to be too holy, for it brings conviction. Many homes aren’t blessed because they don’t make room for God.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brothers and sisters, is your home open to the Presence of God? Is your home the type of environment that the Presence of God can dwell in?</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 4-7	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-2-samuel-1-3-1.png
511	2020-04-08 19:50:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Amalakites were a wicked and idolatrous people. They were a fierce race of nomads who inhabited the desert south of the Judean area towards Egypt. They were a cruel people who lived off raiding, robbing and murdering other tribes. They made life miserable for people who lived near them. When Israel had left the bondage of Egypt, and passed through the Red Sea, the Amalakites came from behind and ambushed the weary, hungry and thirsty Israelites who were lagging behind (Exodus 17:8-16, Deut. 25:17-19).</p><p>The Children of Israel were to never forget what the Amalakites did (Deut. 25:19). As soon as Israel took possession of the Promised Land they were to rid themselves of the Amalakites. The Lord commissioned King Saul to destroy the Amalakites: “Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not” (1 Sam. 15:1-3). Saul partially obeyed the Lord, in that he spared the Amalakite king, Agag, and kept back the best of their flocks (1 Sam. 15:7-9). Saul’s lack of obedience led to his tenure as Israel’s king to be shortened. Not only would his failure to destroy all of the Amalakites end his reign as king, but it would also end his life. For it would be an Amalakite who would deliver the final death blow to Saul (2 Sam. 1:1-13).</p><p>Saul didn’t remember what the Amalakites did previously. He forgot that the Amalakites had destroyed his ancestors and forefathers in the wilderness. He forgot how ruthless they treated his own family.</p><p>Saul didn’t want to completely destroy the Amalakites and King Agag, he instead wanted to pamper and preserve them. Saul wanted to tame the Amalakite king. Agag and the Amalakites are representative of sin. Therefore, you have a much better chance of taming a mountain lion or a rattlesnake than you do of taming sin. We will never tame our flesh and its desires. We must deal with it quickly and severely.</p><p>Furthermore, we better never forget what sin has done to families, friends and acquaintances. Sin waited and attacked while they lagged behind, and were at their weakest. Sin will not treat you and I any different. If we don’t destroy sin now, chances are great that it will kill us later.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 2 Samuel 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-2-Samuel-1-3.png
512	2020-04-07 22:18:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>Saul’s reign as Israel’s king began with so much potential. He was head and shoulders above all the people, yet displayed humility. It wasn’t long before his reign began to go off the rails. He could have been the measuring stick by which all kings would have been measured. Instead he became a skeleton in Israel’s closet.</p><p>At the end of First Samuel, we have the record of Saul being killed during a battle with the Philistines. The Philistines took his dead body, cut off his head, took off his armor and hung his bones in Beth-Shan. It was Saul’s bones hanging in Beth-Shan but it was the skeleton of Israel’s past rattling in the wind as a reminder. Israel needed to move forward but all they could hear was the rattling of Saul’s bones.</p><p>“All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-Shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days” (1 Sam. 31:12-13). Some valiant men weren’t about to let Saul’s bones hang and rattle in the wind. The Philistines used Saul’s bones as a reminder of their victory over one of God’s people. Those valiant men, however, weren’t about to let the enemy celebrate Israel’s dark history. So they rose up, went took the bones down, and buried them.</p><p>We all have those skeletons in our closet. We all have those bones that rattle and shake that remind us of our past. The enemy of our soul likes to rattle our past failures like Saul’s bones in Beth-Shan.</p><p>The valiant men took those bones and buried them under a tree. The best place to bury the skeletons of your past is under the tree of Calvary. Your sinful history can be washed away and covered by the Blood of the Lamb.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 28-31	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-28-31.png
513	2020-04-07 01:38:05	\N	\N	\N	<p>David had javelins thrown at him. The king of Israel was hunting him like wild game. His refuge was in caves with the outcasts of society. Like David, you can get to the point where you begin to question everything. I bet David was wishing he could sling a stone at frustration, and cut the head off of stress.</p><p>“And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: [there is] nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand” (1 Sam. 27:1). You can hear the frustration in David’s words. There was just nothing left for him to do than to give up and quit.</p><p>But notice where those words came from: “David said in his heart.” That terrible advice didn’t come from one of his rag-tag followers. That opinion didn’t come from one of his older brothers. No, that came straight from David’s heart. Exasperated. Exhausted. You ever feel that way with a situation? I know I have. Sometimes it just seems easier to pack your bags up, load up the family grocery-getter and get outta Dodge!</p><p>Those are very real sentiments that we all experience. The issue was where David decided to go. David said, “There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines.” The Philistines. Not somewhere near the Mediterranean Sea, so he could relax in a hammock swinging between two palm trees. He didn’t want a cabin in the mountains so he could continue writing beautiful songs while strumming his harp. No, David’s deceitful heart wanted him to go dwell in the land of the Philistines with the very people he had defeated in battle!</p><p>The human heart is fickle and reckless. When you’re have a bad day your heart starts advising you to do all sorts of ignorant stuff, like going back to things that the Lord has given you victory over. Jeremiah said it best, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it” (Jer. 17:9)? Don’t trust your heart when you’re having a rough go of it.</p><p>David dwelled in the land of the Philistines for sixteen months (1 Sam. 27:7). I’ve seen too many people listen to their heart and go back to things the Lord had delivered them from, only never to return. Rather than trust your wicked heart, listen to the advice of God’s Word: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding, and in all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths” (Pro. 3:5-6).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 25-27	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-25-27.png
514	2020-04-05 23:09:59	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>David became a fugitive. Dreams of being Israel’s next king paled in comparison to the nightmare of being chased down by king Saul. No matter where David went within Israel there were spies updating Saul on David’s every move.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>David found refuge in a cave in Adullam (1 Sam. 22:1). A cave. Not a castle. But a cold wet cave. Who would have thought that Israel’s famed giant killer would be hiding out in a cave? Thankfully David wasn’t alone in his cave. His father and brothers came to see him in his cave. Don’t forget these are the same brothers that ridiculed David for wanting to face Goliath. “Look what killing that giant got you, David.” “Nice place you got here, little brother. You decorate it yourself?” Brothers can be so cruel. Jesse probably sounded like every father, “David, why don’t you come home and have a nice meal with me and your brothers, so we can work this stuff out amongst ourselves. Just let go of this dream of being Israel’s king.” Perhaps David was happy to see his family and a probably little embarrassed too. It’s more than likely, however, that David’s family were scared of Saul too. They needed David, and he needed them too. Thank God for family in times of stress.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t just David’s family who came to his cave. “And everyone that was in distress, and everyone that was in debt, and everyone that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men” (1 Sam. 22:2). Those who were distressed, in debt, and discontented came to be with David.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s what David attracted. He attracted the distressed, the indebted, and the discontented. David didn’t look at those people and turn them away because they lacked particular qualities. No, David took those discontented, indebted, and distressed people and turned them into successful people! Some of those became great warriors and are listed in 2 Samuel 23:8–39 and 1 Chronicles 11:10–41.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Who would have thought that The Son of David, the King of Israel would be crucified upon a cross and buried in a tomb? Like David, Jesus wasn’t accepted as Israel’s true King. But the writer of Hebrews wrote, “For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” David eventually came out of the cave, and along with him came an army. Likewise, Jesus came out of the tomb to become the Captain of salvation for the distressed, the indebted, and the discontented.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 21-24	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-1-samuel-18-20-1.png
515	2020-04-05 15:50:12	\N	\N	\N	<p>I have a four year old daughter. She’s been watching Disney Princess movies since we brought her home from the hospital. At least that’s what it seems like. Of course, in my opinion, Easton is the greatest princess ever. But I digress. One Disney Princess movie stands out from the rest, besides Frozen, and that’s Beauty and the Beast. I have seen that movie more times than any 39 year old man wants to admit.</p><p>Perhaps you are familiar with the story. If not, then let me give you a brief synopsis. A young, handsome, and wealthy prince becomes cursed due to a selfish, prideful choice. Part of his curse turns him into an awful snarling beast. He can never return to what he once was until he learns how to love, and until another loves him.</p><p>Chance takes place and a beautiful young lady by the name of Belle ends up at the Beast’s castle. The Beast is an ugly sight to behold. He’s not the kind of guy you take home to meet your parents, in hopes that they allow you to date him. He’s unrefined, rude, and prone to fits of rage. But somehow, someway, the Beauty falls in love with the Beast.</p><p>What if the Beauty never fell in love with the Beast? What if the Beauty was so turned off by the unpleasant Beast that she escaped the castle only to leave the Beast in his vile condition? Who could blame Belle if she wasn’t attracted to the Beast? He slurped his soup around until it ran down his matted and knotted mane. He didn’t have the type of face that even a mother could love. His bedroom was an absolute mess, with walls covered with torn paintings, cobwebs for curtains, and an unmade bed. And the smell? Can you imagine the odor? A wet dog come in from the rain probably smelled better than the Beast. And what kind of name is Beast? He doesn’t even have an ironic name like Harry, Igor or Pugsley. It’s just Beast. Who could blame Belle if she didn’t want awkward wedding invitations? “You are cordially invited to the wedding of Ms. Belle and Mr. Beast.” Furthermore, their children would have to have names like Minotaur, Sphinx, and Gorgon.</p><p>If Belle were to run far away from the Beast, nobody would blame her. He’s a beast, and she’s a beauty. She’s kind, caring, and loving. The Beast is a hairy, drooling, soup-slurping, beast; fit for a cage not a castle.</p><p>But that’s not what happens. The Beauty sees what nobody else sees in the Beast. Belle loves what nobody else loves. In the end she makes the Beast more beautiful than what he was before the curse.</p><p>This fairy-tale seems quite familiar doesn’t it?</p><h2>The Making of a Beast: The Fall of Humanity</h2><p>Once upon a time there was a prince living in paradise. He was innocent and beautiful. He was made in the image of his Creator, designed to reflect the image of God Almighty (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7). The Maker had given the prince everything anyone could ever need. But the prince was alone, and God said, “It’s not good that man should be alone.” So the Creator designed something more beautiful than man, and that was woman (Gen. 2:18). Adam and Eve lived in serenity, walking with God in the cool of the day.</p><p>All Adam and Eve had to do was keep the garden, be fruitful and multiply, and avoid eating from one singular tree: the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (Gen. 2:15-7). To eat of that tree meant imminent death. Death is such an ugly image, painted with the grimmest of colors.</p><p>Unfortunately, Adam and Eve couldn’t resist that tree. You may say, “Why not live as far away from that tree as humanly possible?” But like all people, they stayed so close to the tree they could hear the seduction of a slithering serpent hanging from its branches.</p><p>“Come and eat. You won’t die” hissed the subtle serpent. He continued his deception by saying, “God the Creator is keeping something from you. He knows that you will become just like Him, that’s why He threatened you with death” (Gen. 3:1-5) Eve was so close to the tree now she could reach out and touch the fruit with her soft fingertips. It wasn’t what she felt with her hands, it’s what she felt in her heart when she gazed at it too long.</p><p>One bite, two bites. “See, Adam. It won’t hurt you. Try it.” Adam bit into that fateful fruit and death was activated. The beautiful blue sky was suddenly covered with clouds, and darkness covered the earth. Adam, Eve, the serpent, and the earth were cursed. The once beautiful couple became beastly. They became just as depraved as the animals they once had dominion over (Gen. 3:6-24). Like an unruly beast they were kicked out of Paradise. Their actions deformed all of humanity into sinners (Rom. 5:19).</p><p>In other words, by one man’s selfish, prideful choice, humanity became like the Beast.</p><ul><li>Brutish</li><li>Abominable</li><li>Coarse</li><li>Depraved</li><li>Loathsome</li><li>Repulsive</li><li>Monstrous</li></ul><p>Sin disfigured the beautiful into beasts. The ruin of mankind was the curse of sin. What was once a dazzling specimen, is now an uncontrollable monstrosity.</p><p>Who could love such beasts as us?</p><ul><li>Unfaithful</li><li>Brutish</li><li>Angry</li><li>Temperamental</li><li>Foul</li><li>Hateful</li><li>Loathsome</li><li>Nauseating</li><li>Vulgar</li><li>Crooks</li><li>Adulterers</li><li>Liars</li><li>Cheats</li><li>Drunken</li><li>Lawless</li><li>Violent</li><li>Rascals</li><li>Phonies</li><li>Corrupted</li><li>Used</li><li>Degraded</li><li>Rejected</li><li>Uncivilized</li></ul><p>Sinful humanity is a barbaric beast. Losing our tempers at the drop of a hat; barking with impatience; slurping the soup of lust and greed while it drips down our vile countenance; showing our fangs to anyone who dares offend us; snarling and growling in attempt to hide how small and weak we truly are; we are unkempt and prefer to stay in our stink. We are fit for cages and not castles.</p><p>This is the nature of the beast. Is it any wonder in the Apocalypse that John depicts that which is Anti-Christ as a Beasts? John uses beast-like imagery to describe these blasphemous creatures. Seven heads, ten horns, leopards, paws like a bear, a mouth like a lion. Another has two horns like a lamb and it speaks like a dragon (Rev. 13:1-18). What grotesque creatures!</p><p>But that’s what sin does to all of us. It makes us Anti-Christ. Beastly. We speak blasphemies, cause wars, and worship loathsome images. Sin causes us to do things that we wouldn’t normally do.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate. And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can’t. I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. But if I do what I don’t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it (Romans 7:15; 18-20 NLT).</p></blockquote><p>I’m nothing but a brute beast; unlovable and irredeemable.</p><blockquote><p>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? (Romans 7:24 NKJV)</p></blockquote><h2>The Beauty</h2><p>Who could love such a beast? Who would be willing to come near beasts such as us? Surely there couldn’t be anyone of beauty and grace that could love us brutes.</p><p>But that’s exactly what happened. It wasn’t chance, it was ordained from the foundation of the world.</p><p>Jesus Christ, the God-Man, came to our shadowy havens. He wasn’t put-off with the stench of our sin. He wasn’t turned off by our ugly pride, and grisly cravings. Our hideous howling didn’t intimidate Him. Neither did our selfish behavior alarm Him. He came near our cage of brokenness and began to soothe us with calming words (Hos. 2:14). Beyond our fangs and horns there were tears. Like a mistreated animal, we shivered in the corner of the cage, until He reached in and touched us. And immediately our self-defense mechanisms came crumbling down. The cage door was opened and freedom from our beastly nature was available.</p><p>All this time we’ve been simply known as Sinner. Loser. Failure. Adulterer. Cheater. Liar. Mistake. Orphan. Drunk. Unwanted. Ugly. Broken.</p><p>Beast.</p><p>Who could love us? Jesus. What a beautiful name that is. He is not apprehensive of being associated with us. He wants His beautiful Name bestowed upon us.</p><p>Slowly, the beast is being tamed. No longer do I hunch down in shame of my behavior, so I stand a little straighter. The Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the Valley brings me into His Kingdom, and gives me shelter. Beauty cleans me up, and clothes me with righteousness. He brings me to His banquet hall and his banner over me is love (Song 2:4). The Altogether Lovely One smiles offering grace and reform when I fall back to my old habits of slurping.</p><h2>What If?</h2><p>What if the Beauty never fell in love with the Beast? What if the Beauty was so turned off by the unpleasant Beast that He escaped the castle only to leave the Beast in his vile condition? Who could blame Jesus if He wasn’t attracted to the Beast?</p><p>If Jesus were to run far away from the Beast, nobody would blame Him. We’re beasts, and He is beautiful. He’s kind, gracious, and loving. We Beasts are a sinning, selfish, hateful bunch fit for a cage not a Kingdom.</p><p>But that’s not what happens. Jesus sees what nobody else sees in us. Jesus loves what nobody else loves. He loves us, even though we aren’t fit for loving. In the end He makes us more beautiful than what we were before the curse of sin.</p><p>Sin ruined, but grace restored. Sin disfigured, but grace reformed. Sin killed, but grace remade. In other words:</p><blockquote><p>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Cor. 5:17).</p></blockquote><p>That old creature is gone. That old beast is no longer in existence. I’m a new creature &#8211; a new man. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me (Gal. 2:20).</p><p>All of us are beasts. Sin is ugly. It’s a destructive force that maims and deforms. But Jesus Christ has come to your cage today. The light has shone through the shadows of the curse to bring blessing and life.</p><p>Jesus wants to give you beauty for ashes. He wants to anoint you with the oil of joy instead of mourning. He wants to give you the garment of praise in exchange for your spirit of heaviness (Isaiah 61:3)</p><p>It’s truly the Beauty and the Beast.</p>	100	\N	The Beauty and the Beast	\N	/beautyandbeast.png
516	2020-04-04 18:13:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>Saul became jealous of David after his defeat of Goliath. Why would Saul be jealous of David after he just brought about one of the greatest victories ever seen in Israel? The women came out of all cities of Israel, singing a new song: “Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands” (1 Sam. 18:6-7). Saul had never heard a more irritating song in his life. It wasn’t that Saul wasn’t being praised, its that David was being praised more. Jealousy is a cruel taskmaster. It will blind you of your own victories and self-worth. Jealousy will talk you out of any logical thinking. For instance, like any good political leader, Saul could have used the power of spin to make everyone believe that Goliath’s downfall was accomplished though his visionary leadership of sending a mighty warrior dressed as a mere shepherd boy. But those thoughts were drowned out by jealousy’s rage as the women of Israel continued to sing David’s praises.</p><p>Goliath wouldn’t be David’s last giant to face. David ran towards Goliath in the valley of Elah. Now he was running away from Israel’s jealous king. There was no stone that David could sling to rid himself of this giant. Likewise, for Saul there would be no song that would soothe his jealous fits.</p><p>David couldn’t control Saul’s murderous plots. David could, however, control himself. First Samuel 18 records three times that David behaved himself wisely (1 Sam. 18:5,14, 30). What do you do when someone wants to ruin your life? You behave wisely. What do you do when people are jealous of your success? You behave wisely. What do you when you are running for your life? You behave wisely. Proverbs records, “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding” (Pro. 4:7). David didn’t need a stone or a sword to rid himself of Saul, he needed wisdom.</p><p>Our world would be in a lot better shape if they learned to behave wisely. The next time you want to post a smart-aleck comment on social media ask yourself, “Is this wise?” The next time someone tries to attack your character, put down your sword and pick up wisdom. When things get heated at the office and others act like fools, be sure to behave wisely. You may not be able to control others, but you can control yourself with wisdom.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 18-20	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-18-20.png
517	2020-04-04 02:20:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>The most familiar story in the life of David is his battle with Goliath. References abound to David and Goliath in popular culture. You wouldn’t have to darken the door of a Sunday school class to be familiar with the story of David and Goliath.</p><p>Goliath stood at least 9’6” tall. The armor that he wore weighed at least 125 pounds. The iron head of his spear weighed somewhere between 15-16 pounds. He was an intimidating specimen. Armies of men ran and hid when the giant parted the crowds to stand in the valley. And as he approached the army of Israel he said, “And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together” (1 Sam. 17:10). Saul and the armies of Israel feared this giant of a man. No one was willing to face him. For forty days they put up with this nonsense.</p><p>David was Jesse’s youngest son who looked after his father’s flock. He didn’t possess a physical prowess that caught anyone’s attention (16:12). When Samuel the prophet came to Jesse’s house to anoint a new king, it was David whom God had chosen, not his more capable older brothers. Samuel anointed him with the horn of oil and, the spirit of the Lord came rushing upon David (16:13). Later on Jesse sent David to check on his three older brothers who were with Saul in the battle with Philistines. As David approached the battle he could see the men running and hiding from the giant. To add insult to injury, David listened to Goliath’s mockery and ridicule of Israel.</p><p>After brushing off his own brother’s negative comments concerning David’s willingness to fight Goliath, and Saul’s attempt to talk him out of fighting the battle-tested giant, David picked us five smooth stones and set out to defeat the giant.</p><p>Let’s stop and pause for a moment. Most preachers and teachers have taken their liberty to make David representative of you and me. They say things like, “You will defeat your giant!” Granted, I’ve been guilty of making such claims.</p><p>But in reality, you and me are in this story. It’s just that we aren’t David. We are Israel trembling and hiding in tents. We are David’s brothers, making excuses for why we won’t fight the giant. We are Saul, trying to cover our fear with logical arguments. That’s us. Like Israel, David’s brothers, and Saul we were unable to fight the battle for our salvation. Sin is the battle-tested giant that has claimed a myriad of lives. A warrior from his youth, his sword is stained with the blood of weaker men and women.</p><p>David doesn’t represent you and me. No, he represents David’s Greater Son, Jesus Christ. Who fought the giant of sin for us. He unarmed that giant and rendered him powerless. Through Jesus Christ, the Son of David, we are able to come out from hiding and run to Him in victory.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 15-17	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-15-17.png
518	2020-04-03 01:23:03	\N	\N	\N	<p>Saul’s reign as Israel’s king was rocky to say the least. During a battle with the Philistines, Saul acted out of fear and offered a burnt offering, instead of waiting on Samuel to arrive (1 Sam. 13:5-9). Samuel said, “Thou hast don’t foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee” (1 Sam. 13:13). Additionally, Samuel prophesied that Saul would be replaced as king with a man after God’s own heart (1 Sam. 13:14). Needless to say, things weren’t going well in Israel.</p><p>While Saul was sulking under a pomegranate tree in Gibeah, Jonathan, his son, was plotting a secret attack against the Philistines (1 Sam. 14:1-3). Along with his armor-bearer, Jonathan secretly ran off to the Philistine’s camp. Listen to Jonathan’s faith: &#8220;It may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few” (1 Sam. 14:6). You maybe asking why Jonathan didn’t let Saul in on his secret mission. Saul wasn’t a shining example of faith and obedience, from what we read in the previous chapter. Jonathan’s faith wasn’t a product of his present environment. Instead, Jonathan had a personal faith in God.</p><p>Jonathan had faith, but it was realistic faith. “Perhaps the Lord will work for us.” The Lord may work this out, or He may not. That doesn’t sound like the faith of an overzealous televangelist! Jonathan wasn’t tempting God by going into the Philistine’s camp with only himself and his armor-bearer. No, Jonathan believed that God could save by many or by few. But God wasn’t going to work unless someone got up from under the tree of self-pity and exercised some faith. And Jonathan was right, God worked in such a way that only He received the glory.</p><p>Do you have that kind of faith? The kind of faith that says, “God might work this out, or He might not. But I’m going to pray and believe anyway.” Others might be sitting under a tree of fear and anxiety, but you don’t need others to verify your faith.</p><p>Because if it’s just you and the Lord, He can save by many or by few, even if it’s just the Lord and you.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 13-14	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-13-14.png
519	2020-04-01 22:24:20	\N	\N	\N	<p>Israel desired a king like all the other nations. The Lord chose Saul from the tribe of Benjamin. Samuel had anointed Saul privately but the prophet wanted to publicly reveal to Israel their first king. As the tribes gathered together and Samuel made his pronouncement, the tall handsome young man could not be found. It was Saul’s first public appearance, and yet he doesn’t come out from behind the curtain. Again the prophet announces his name and again, no Saul. Does Saul have a strong case stage fright or the jitters? What ever the case may be, Saul is nowhere to be found.</p><p>“And when they sought him, he could not be found. Therefore they inquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff” (1 Sam. 10:21-22). Saul was hidden among the stuff. Israel’s crown awaited him, but he was hiding among the stuff. The royal diadem of Israel anticipated Saul’s debut, but he was hiding among the stuff. Israel’s king was hidden among the stuff.</p><p>The word “<em>stuff</em>” in the Hebrew is translated as “<em>baggage</em>.” Saul was hiding from a crown among the trifles of baggage. Could there be anything in the baggage that was worth more than the crown and power of kingship and royalty? Whatever it was, it was of little importance, but enough to keep Saul from claiming what God had chosen for him.</p><p>Talk to people about their own souls and you will find their souls are of little value compared to drugs, alcohol, partying, revelry, supposed success and earthly riches. They have traded the crowns of glory for earthly stuff that will never fulfill them. A royal crown awaits them, but they are hidden among the stuff.</p><p>The apostle Paul wrote, “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible” (1 Cor. 9:25). Corruptible crowns will eventually end up in the trash heap of stuff, where moth and dust reign.</p><p>The tribes of Israel eagerly awaited the man who would become their leader. To no avail he didn’t come on his own accord, but they had to go and fetch him. The word “<em>fetch</em>” in the Hebrew means to “<em>grasp</em>,” “<em>seize</em>,” “<em>take,</em>” “<em>obtain</em>,” or “<em>capture</em>.” Hidden among the stuff is potential and possibilities, but it’s got to be seized and claimed.</p><p>Beloved, are you hiding among the stuff?

That was the Lord’s response to Samuel when Israel demanded a king. They hadn’t rejected Samuel’s leadership, they had rejected the Lord’s kingship.</p><p>Israel was supposed to be a theocracy, a nation whose king was the Lord. Rather than have the Lord rule over them, they wanted to be like all the other nations (1 Sam. 8:5). Israel didn’t want to stand out and be a peculiar people. Instead they wanted to blend in.</p><p>Samuel revealed to Israel what having a king and being like other nations looked liked: The king will take your sons to be his soldiers; he will appoint leaders will the sole purpose of making weapons for war; he will take your daughters to be his servants; he will take your fields, and vineyards to give to his servants; he will tax your income; and you will cry out to the Lord wishing that you never asked for a king (1 Sam. 8:10-18).</p><p>You would think that hearing such a warning would change their minds. But it didn’t. “Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said ‘Nay; but we will have a king over us; that we may be like all the nations” (1 Sam. 10:19-20).</p><p>Israel was willing to sacrifice their freedom, families, possessions, and identity so they could be like all the other nations. What a sad indictment! In place of being God’s distinct people, representing Him to all nations, they settled for being like the masses.</p><p>Sadly there are many Christians willing to forfeit their spiritual freedom, families, possessions, and identity of being God’s people, for the sake of blending in with the world. Beloved, God didn’t save us so we can be like the world. God saved us that we might stand out and be a witness of God’s glory. The apostle Peter said it best, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1 Pt. 2:9).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 4-8	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-4-8.png
521	2020-03-31 01:29:00	\N	\N	\N	<p>Hannah wanted a son, and Israel needed a prophet. That’s how First Samuel opens. Hannah was barren, unable to have children. Israel, on the other hand, was spiritually barren. The answer for both Hannah and Israel was Samuel. Samuel would be the son that Hannah desperately desired; and he would be the prophet that would lead Israel back to God. The difference between Hannah and Israel, was that Hannah knew she wanted a son. On the contrary, Israel didn’t know they needed a prophet.</p><p>The sun was about to set on the office of the judges. Eli, the high priest, would judge Israel for forty years (1 Sam. 4:18). Unfortunately, he and his sons didn’t possess the highest of character. Eli’s sons were corrupt, taking advantage of God’s people. Eli refused to correct his sons, which led to all of their downfall.</p><p>Hannah desperately prayed, “O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give your servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head” (1 Sam. 1:11). Hannah was willing to ask God to give her a son, but also willing to commit him to the Lord. As much as she wanted a son, Israel needed a prophet.</p><p>Often times our greatest obstacles are given to provoke us to prayer. Hannah’s obstacle of barrenness roused her to pray for a son. God used Hannah’s hardship to give her and Israel a miracle. But the miracle hinged upon Hanna’s prayer.</p><p>Beloved, don’t look at your current obstacle as a stumbling block. View your obstacle as an opportunity to pray and see the Lord work a miracle.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible 1 Samuel 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-1-Samuel-1-3.png
522	2020-03-29 23:04:51	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Naomi received word that the drought was over in Bethlehem-Judah. The now childless widow had nothing keeping her in Moab. All that was left were her two widowed Moabite daughter in-laws, Orpah and Ruth. The two young ladies decided it was best to follow Naomi to Bethlehem, the House of Bread.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The three of them headed towards Bethlehem-Judah, to which Naomi told them both to head back towards Moab. Naomi wanted to return to Bethlehem alone. She didn’t want to be a burden to these two young women. Furthermore, Naomi realized that she wouldn’t have anymore sons for the women to marry. They just needed to go back home and move on with their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Orpah and Ruth had a choice, they could either go back to Moab, the washpot, or go towards Bethlehem, the House of Bread. Orpah kissed her mother in-law with an affectionate farewell to go back to Moab. She had left her hometown for a time, but now she was heading back.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are many who for a moment are urged by feelings or emotions and leave the world. But after sometime they begin to count the cost of leaving their old life behind, and look at the journey ahead. For Naomi and her daughters in-law, the trip from Moab to Bethlehem would have taken between 7-10 days. It would have required them to cross the river Jordan and to climb the 2000 plus feet in elevation required to reach Bethlehem. For Orpah, that was just too far. It was far easier to return to her old lifestyle in God’s washpot, than to continue towards Bethlehem.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ruth, on the other hand, well she didn’t kiss Naomi goodbye. No, she kissed Moab goodbye, and clave to her mother-in-law. Ruth boldly proclaimed, “Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God” (Ruth 1:16). What a confession faith! Ruth was willing to forsake her old lifestyle, her old friends, and her old religion. The journey to the House of Bread was far more enticing than the return to God’s washpot.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What a destiny altering decision Ruth made! God would providentially order Ruth’s steps guiding her to the fields of Boaz. He was Naomi’s kinsman-redeemer. In other words, he had the legal right to claim Naomi’s family inheritance, which included a Moabite widow. What Ruth didn’t realize when she made that life-altering decision to cleave to Naomi, was that she would be included in the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Kinsman-Redeemer of all humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, kiss the world goodbye, and cleave to the Kinsman-Redeemer!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Ruth 3-4	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-ruth-1-2-1.png

The pitcher was filled with clean water and was poured out on the unclean hands, or dust covered feet that then filled the washpot. No one would use the water in the basin again to wash.

Life without a king.</p><p>Israel failed to remove their enemies from their land and disobeyed God (Jud. 1-3). That’s life without a king. Israel worshiped and served idols (Jud. 2:11-13). That’s life without a king. Because of Israel’s backsliding they were oppressed by their enemies (Jud. 2:14-15). That’s life without a king. Israel depended upon men and women to liberate them (Jud. 2:16-23). That’s life without a king. Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord (Jud. 4:1). That’s life without a king. Brothers go to war with each other (Jud. 9:1-57). That’s life without a king. Men hastily make awful vows (Jud. 11:30-40). That’s life without a king. Strong men easily break life-long vows (Jud. 13-16). That’s life without a king. Weak men become their own priests (Jud. 17-18). That’s life without a king. Sordid lifestyles and degenerate behaviors become the norm (Jud. 19-20). That’s life without a king.</p><p>Life without a king in Israel was nothing more than confusion and chaos. At the same time, when we try to live our lives without a king we aren’t in any better shape.</p><p>Failure to remove sin from our lives. That’s life without a king. Worshiping the false gods of money, sex, and entertainment. That’s life without a king. Depending upon anything other than God to liberate us. That’s life without a king. Constantly being lured back into old lifestyles. That’s life without a king. Fighting one another when we should be fighting for our own deliverance. That’s life without a king. Hastily making vows to careers that cost us our families. That’s life without a king. Breaking godly vows without a second thought. That’s life without a king.

If you ever read comics, or watched a superhero movie then you know the villain is always looking for ways to defeat his arch nemesis. The villain’s evil plots are never going to come to pass if the hero is there to thwart the evil plan. Therefore, the villain looks for ways to weaken the hero, either by poisoning him, or holding someone they loved hostage. The villain is looking for the superhero’s weakness. If the villain can reveal the weakness he can destroy the hero.</p><p>That’s what makes this part of Samson’s story so intriguing. The Philistines wanted to know where Samson got his strength. They wanted to know what made him supernaturally strong. If the Philistines could reveal Samson’s source of strength, they could rid themselves of Samson and their evil plans could prevail. Wouldn’t they want to know where his weakness was instead? Wouldn’t they want to reveal his vulnerability? Wouldn&#8217;t they want to expose his soft spot? I want to submit to you that the Philistines, and everyone else, knew where Samson was weak. Samson couldn’t hide his weakness.</p><p>Samson’s strength came from the Lord, but Samson’s weakness was in his flesh. The supernatural power came from a life separated unto God, but Samson’s weakness was that he couldn’t say no to his fleshly desires.</p><p>Samson could kill lions, catch foxes by their tails, and kill a thousand men with a jawbone of a donkey. The only thing that rivaled Samson’s supernatural strength was his weakness. Samson desired the love of many women. He couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes from lusting after them.</p><p>Samson could conjure up the Spirit of God to overcome a multitude of enemies. It’s unfortunate that he didn’t use that same Spirit to defeat his inner enemies.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the greatest enemy we have isn’t without, it’s within. The apostle Paul wrote, “For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live” (Rom. 8:13 ESV).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-16-18.png
526	2020-03-26 00:17:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>The spiritual climate in Israel grew colder. Israel was now indifferent to Jehovah and to the idea of being bondage. They hadn’t learned the lesson of keeping themselves from idols which inevitably led to them doing evil again in the sight of the LORD. This time God allowed them to be oppressed by the hands of the Philistines for forty years.</p><p>There is some hope in Israel for there was a couple that had not turned to either worshiping an idol or to doing evil. Manoah and his wife were the minority in Israel in that they were faithful to the Lord. Take notice that the Holy Spirit does not reveal Manoah’s wife’s name. Even though her name is not given, she is still given divine grace. She was nameless, but she was faithful. So be it if we don’t know the name of Samson’s mother. What matters is that God knows her name and He chose her to fulfill His work. There are many people who are visited by the Spirit of God who will never be known by the masses. We may never hear their names in our ears, but rest assured, God knows their names. Being famous is not a qualification for being used by God.</p><p>The angel of the LORD appeared unto Manoah’s wife. His presence may have been amazing, but his message was just as staggering. Though she was barren, she was to have a son. Furthermore, she was not to drink any wine or strong drink and not to eat any unclean thing. The demands of Manoah’s wife were imperative. The condition of having a son came with the price of keeping herself undefiled. Modern day mothers are taught not to drink alcoholic beverages or to indulge in smoking due to the fact that it could harm and addict the baby to alcohol and nicotine. But this was not the entire point of the command. God’s command went beyond the child’s health and reached to his spirit.</p><p>Samson’s consecration did not begin at his birth but began at his conception. Samson’s example of holiness would come from his parents. And notice that it would begin before he would be born. Many times parents try too late to give their children an example of consecration and holiness.</p><p>Beloved, the home is the birthplace of holiness. Church isn’t to be the only example of holiness a child is to experience. It’s the home that will guide and teach. I have seen time and time again what a church accomplishes in teaching spiritual principles to a child is often undone in the home. God gave the command first to Samson’s mother and then to Samson. How could Samson be holy if he didn’t know what holiness looked like? Israel’s culture was incapable of teaching Samson because they were doing what was unacceptable to God. If we are to raise holy children we must be holy ourselves.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 13-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-13-15.png

But once again, Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and worshiped idols. The Lord sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and the Ammonites, and they were oppressed for eighteen years (Jud. 10:1-9).</p><p>This time, however, things were different. When the children of Israel cried out, the Lord rebuked them. He reminded them of all the times he had delivered them, and yet they continued to worship false gods (Jud. 10:12). The Lord said, “Therefore I will deliver you no more. Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress” (Jud. 10:13-14). In other words, if Israel wanted to worship false gods, then they should rely upon those same gods to deliver them from their oppressors.</p><p>The Lord’s rebuke of Israel should strike fear into our hearts. God’s grace and mercy shouldn’t be trifled with. We may not think we reject Christ to serve false gods, but anytime we choose to serve the lusts and desires of our flesh we are rejecting Him. In essence we are placing our trust in those desires to fulfill our wants and needs. In reality, though, they are enslaving us. What we believe yields satisfaction actually produces slavery.</p><p>Israel said to the Lord, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems best to You; only deliver us this day, we pray” (Jud. 10:15). So they put away the false gods from among them and served the Lord. Please take note of the Lord’s response: “and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel” (Jud. 10:16). God couldn’t stand to see Israel suffer any longer.</p><p>Many believe the the God of the Old Testament was only a God of judgement. The book of Judges proves otherwise. God is holy and demands justice for sin. On the other hand, though, God is merciful and doesn’t give sinful humanity what they deserve. Those of us who have been forgiven of our sins, know first-hand that we did not get what we deserved. Let us be thankful for the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 10-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-10-12.png

Israel had quickly forgotten what the Lord had done for them, and the victory that Gideon wrought. Israel’s lack of spiritual leadership was proving to be futile.</p><p>Gideon had served Israel as a judge, not as a king. After his death, Israel’s void for a leader needed filled. History has shown that sons follow in their father’s footsteps, whether willingly or reluctantly. But that may not always be God’s will. The role of judge in Israel wasn’t one of a dynasty. But that didn’t stop Gideon’s son, Abimelech. It was his life’s ambition to be the leader, though that certainly wasn’t God’s plan. His plot was to go to his mother’s kindred in Shechem and become their king.</p><p>Abimelech sought out people who agreed with him (Jud. 9:1-2). Did the people want seventy sons of Gideon overseeing them? Or did they want just one strong-willed man as their leader? Of course they chose Abimelech.</p><p>As we have seen early on in Judges, everyone did what is right in their own eyes (Jud. 21:25). That is certainly the case with Abimelech. God hadn’t anointed him to be Israel’s judge, so he secured allegiance from the men of Shechem, and became their assumed king. To make matters worse, he killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Gideon at Ophrah (Jud. 9:5-6). Thankfully, one of Gideon’s son survived (Jud. 9:5).</p><p>Abimelech believed himself to be a noble tree offering shade to feeble souls. But in reality, he was nothing more than a weed (Jud. 9:7-20). God wasn’t going to have someone like that to be Israel’s leader. God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, and brought about quick judgment.</p><p>What can we learn about Abimelech? First, you can always find sympathizers, no matter how wrong you might be. There will always be weak-minded people who will listen to your complaints and negativity. Beloved, you should avoid people like Abimelech. They will only cause you more harm than good. Second, it’s dangerous to think more highly of ourselves than we should (Rom. 12:3). God has a purpose for each person’s life. But we should wait and pray for God to call and anoint us for a given task or role. It’s better to be a servant in God’s kingdom, than to be a king in your own bedlam.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 8-9	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-8-9.png

There’s something special about seeing the little guy have his day. The story of Gideon is that of an underdog.</p><p>Israel, again, did evil in the sight of the Lord. For punishment, He gave Israel over to the Midianites. Part of the Midianite’s oppressive strategy, was to come and take Israel’s harvest each time they would plant and sow. In order to stave off future attacks, Israel built caves, dens and strongholds to hide out in. Needless to say, the land was greatly impoverished due to the Midianites.</p><p>If we were to choose a man to lead Israel’s armies, it&#8217;s more than likely we would choose the strongest man in the nation. We’d desire the most qualified and capable person to lead and fight the battle. Perhaps that is why we are so troubled with the Bible, we are too wrapped up with physical abilities. As we have seen time and again it’s that God calls servants, not heroes. He picks the weakest and not the strongest.</p><p>God comes to Gideon and calls him, “mighty man of valor.” Gideon didn’t see himself as a mighty anything, let alone a mighty man of valor. He was the least likely of candidates. He was just an obscure farmer who lived in the insignificant town of Orpah located in Mannaseh. Furthermore, he was part of the crowd that hid when the Midianites would show up. That doesn’t look like valor or might, if you’re asking me. But that’s exactly who God was looking for. God was looking for someone who didn’t trust in their own capabilities.</p><p>So what is the Lord going to do to help Gideon? Is the Lord going to give Gideon a huge army to lead? No, the Lord only allowed three hundred men to fight alongside Gideon. Is the Lord going to equip Gideon’s small army with superior armor and weapons? No, He’s only going to let them use trumpets and broken pitchers. God is also going to strike fear in Gideon’s enemies by having a man dream about a runaway barley cake!</p><p>The Lord employs feeble means to bring about victory for His people. Beloved, don’t you see that if He can use all of these frail, and weak instruments, that He can use you and me?</p></div>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 6-7	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-6-7.png

Now after several centuries, the people of Israel were under the oppression of the Mesopotamians, on account that Israel had gone back into idolatry. They began worshiping false gods, and started to intermarry with the Canaanites (Jud. 3:6-7). Mesopotamia, like Egypt, represents the world and all its allurements. By attempting to become like the world they lived in, they failed to be the light that the world desperately needed.</p><p>For Israel’s backsliding, they served the king of Mesopotamia for eight years (Jud. 3:8). Eight years is a long time to be oppressed. But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, He raised up a judge who could deliver them. Othniel became the first leader after the death of Joshua (Jud. 3:9). Ohtniel, whose name means “lion of God,” was the nephew and son-in-law of Caleb. Othniel became Caleb’s son-in-law when he accepted Caleb’s challenge of conquering Kiriath-sepher (Josh. 15:16-17).</p><p>The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel and he prevailed against the king of Mesopotamia. The word “prevailed” in the Hebrew means to “be strong.” The apostle Paul wrote, “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might” (Eph. 6:10). We can only prevail when we are endued with God’s power. Spiritual power, however, is only attained when we live differently from the world. Othniel wasn’t living like the rest of Israel when the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him.

531	2020-03-18 22:08:55	\N	\N	\N	<p>The books of Judges is exhausting and exhilarating. It’s exhausting because the same thing happens repeatedly. It’s exciting because the Lord does extraordinary things through very ordinary people.</p><p>The book’s theme can be found in its final verse: “In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes” (Jud. 21:25). This is a sad indictment of Israel. The climax of Joshua details Israel’s conquest of Canaan, and their recommitment to God (Josh. 24:1-28). How did things get so bad in Israel? The answer is found in today’s reading. Six times in chapter one we read how particular tribes failed to drive out the remaining inhabitants of Canaan (Jud. 1:21,27,29,30,31,33). Their failure to completely remove the false worship from their territories was considered disobedience (Jud. 2:1-5).</p><p>Then to make matters worse, Joshua and his generation died leaving behind an inept generation (Jud. 2:7-10). The new generation abandoned the God of their fathers, and went after the false gods of Canaan (Jud. 2:12). For that purpose the Lord gave them over to various oppressors (Jud. 2:14-15). Furthermore, that generation had never fought a battle before. They had soft hands and jelly spines (Jud. 3:1-2).</p><p>“Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them” (Jud. 2:16). Since there was no king in Israel, and every man did that which was right in his own eyes, the Lord raised up judges. You might be picturing a judge wearing a black robe sitting behind a large desk with a gavel in his hand. Instead, this judge was a deliverer, in the form of a military leader.</p><p>Here’s where the story gets exhausting. Israel would backslide and worship false gods. God would send an enemy to oppress Israel. Israel would cry out to God for help. God would raise up a judge. The judge would deliver Israel. The judge would die, and the people would backslide again. Wash and repeat.</p><p>What makes the book exciting is God using a crowd of nobodies to do His work. Othniel; Ehud; Deborah; Shamgar; Gideon; Jepthah; and Samson. The apostle Paul would describe these heroes by saying, “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty” (1 Cor. 27-29). And that’s exactly what God does time after time in this exhilarating book.</p><p>Though man’s plight, and potential are on display in this book, that is not the main storyline. The overarching story is God’s long-suffering, and love. God desires His people’s complete devotion. And while they fail over and over again, He continues to pursue them. He does this by raising up judges to deliver them. However, God’s greatest display of love was when He gave us a True Deliverer in Jesus Christ.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Judges 1-2	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Judges-1-2.png
532	2020-03-17 20:20:28	\N	\N	\N	<p>Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem for one final address. He began by recounting God’s redemptive acts in Israel’s short history. Joshua wanted to make sure the people understood their history, their present, and their future. Had God not revealed Himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; worked mightily through Moses to bring them out of Egypt; and given them the land of Canaan, then they wouldn’t have any identity as a people (Josh. 24:1-13).</p><p>Joshua needed to remind them of their present responsibilities living as God’s people. Joshua said, “<em>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in severity and in truth</em>” (Josh. 24:14). Israel was to put away any gods the previous generation may have served, and serve Jehovah completely.</p><p>Joshua used the word “<em>serve</em>” fifteen times in this final address. The Hebrew word for “<em>serve</em>” that is employed here means to “<em>toil</em>,” “<em>work,</em>” or “<em>expend considerable energy and intensity in a task or function</em>.” You cannot expend considerable energy on more than one thing. Jesus said it like this, “<em>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon</em>” (Mt. 6:24). That’s why Joshua told the people to put away any other gods. Jehovah is a jealous God, and He will not share the space within any heart (Ex. 24:14; Josh. 24:19).</p><p>This was Joshua’s proclamation, “<em>but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord</em>” (Josh. 24:15). It didn’t matter to Joshua if anyone else in Israel served the Lord. He had made up his mind that he and his family would serve Him!</p><p>Dear reader, what are you serving? What are you giving your time and energy to? What are you devoting your life to? Put away anything that would steal your devotion to Jesus Christ. Beloved, serve the Lord with gladness!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 23-24	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-23-24.png
533	2020-03-17 01:29:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>You might remember from our reading in Numbers how the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and a portion of Manasseh requested to settle in the land east of the Jordan River (Num. 32:1-42). Moses granted their request as long as they fought with the others tribes during the Canaan conquest. After the death of Moses, they promised Joshua to remain loyal to their initial commitment (Josh. 1:12-13).</p><p>Having completed their mission, Joshua allowed them to return to the land east of the Jordan (Josh. 22:1-3). Joshua reminded them to keep the Lord’s commandments despite not dwelling with the rest of the tribes of Israel (Josh. 22:5). Upon their arrival to their homeland, these tribes built an altar they called “Ed,” which means “witness.” Word reached the western tribes that an altar had been built, and they were immediately outraged. The western tribes journeyed to confront the eastern tribes. In essence they asked, “Don’t you remember what happened because of Balaam’s advice and Achan’s sin?” (Josh. 22:11-20). The majority of Israel was concerned that these three tribes were in rebellion for building an alternative altar.</p><p>Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh claimed that they had built the altar as a memorial for future generations. In other words, these two and half tribes wanted the altar to be a witness that they were in fact God’s people too. There wouldn’t have been any need for a memorial had they settled with all the other tribes in the western side of the Jordan River. Bible commentator, Warren Wiersbe notes, “The stones may have been a witness, but the people certainly were not. Surrounded by heathen nations and separated from their brothers and sisters across the river, these tribes quickly fell into idolatry and were eventually taken by Assyria (1 Chr. 5:25, 26).”</p><p>Beloved, stay committed to God and to His people.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 19-22	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-19-22.png
534	2020-03-15 21:52:06	\N	\N	\N	<p>In today’s reading we have an account of the inheritance of Joseph divided between his sons Ephraim and Manasseh. Ephraim’s allotment was a beautiful and fertile area. Howbeit, the difficulty of possessing the land included clearing out additional hill country and removing the Canaanites from the land. There was just one issue: “And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute” (Josh. 16:10). They excavated the hill country, but allowed some of the Canaanites to stay in the land. This is the first mention of Israel’s oversight of God’s command to expel the land of all its idolators (Deut. 20:16).</p><p>Manasseh didn’t do much better. Manasseh’s land was just as rich as Ephraim’s but they too left some of the Canaanites in the land: “Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out” (Josh. 17:12-13).</p><p>Ephraim and Manasseh accommodated the Canaanites when they should have annihilated them. The Lord told Israel that the residents of Canaan must not stay in the land (Ex. 23:33). The Canaanite’s false worship would surely infect Israel unless they eliminated it like a surgeon removing a cancerous growth (Ex. 23:32-33; Deut. 7:4).</p><p>Ephraim and Manasseh attempted to enslave their foes. Their attempts to train their enemy was all but futile. Herbert Lockyer wrote, “The spiritual application is obvious. Victorious in so many way, there are yet those Canaanites we are unwilling to part with. ‘Destory all,’ says God. Alas, however, we find it hard to slay some darling sins.”</p><p>Brothers and sisters, sin will not be trained or restrained. Sin only seeks to enslave and rule. Don’t allow darling sins to dwell where God has given you dominion. As the great puritan John Owen wrote, “Be killing sin, or sin will be killing you.”</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-16-18.png
535	2020-03-14 21:09:41	\N	\N	\N	<p>Only two men believed Israel could take possession of Canaan the first time Moses sent twelve men to spy out the land. Joshua and Caleb were those two men. And they were the only two men from that generation that were able to enter the Promised Land (Num. 14:24,30,38).</p><p>Understand that Caleb was born as a bondage baby in Egypt. He grew up eating the leeks and onions. He was well acquainted with the oppressions of living in Egypt. Furthermore, he witnessed first-hand the miracles wrought by the hand of God in Egypt and the wilderness. There’s no wonder why he believed the giants in Canaan were no match for God. While his fellow spies only seen giants, he had visions of God (Num. 13:30)! That’s because Caleb had a different kind of spirit, which enabled him to wholly follow after God (Num. 14:24; Josh. 14:8-9).</p><p>The next time we read about Caleb, however, is when the land is being divided up amongst the tribes of Israel. Forty-five years had passed since Caleb’s first journey to Canaan making him eighty-five years old. Now the time had come for Caleb to claim his portion of the land. Caleb said, “Now therefore give me this mountain” (Josh. 14:12). The mountain of which Caleb spoke was greatly fortified and filled with giants! Caleb may have been old, but he wasn’t about to let any giants stop him. Caleb, at his age, could have desired beach front properties that didn’t have giants. But Caleb wasn’t that kind of man.</p><p>A mountain meant it was an uphill battle. Caleb wanted it. The giants were bigger than him and his men. Caleb still wanted it. The city was greatly fortified, which meant they had to be torn down. Not a problem for Caleb.</p><p>Caleb’s name in the Hebrew means “dog.” That perfectly sums up his life. Caleb had a dogged desire to do hard things. And like a good dog, he wholly followed after the Lord. Caleb was bark and bite! He wanted the mountain, and the giants.</p><p>Dear reader, what is your mountain? Go take possession of it. Where are your giants? Go face and overcome them. Caleb had a different spirit, but we have the Holy Spirit! Now, go get your mountain!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 12-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-12-15.png
536	2020-03-14 00:24:04	\N	\N	\N	<p>Israel had finally crossed over from their wilderness wanderings and were laying claim to God’s promises. Joshua led the armies of Israel on their first mission and conquered Jericho. The Lord gave the command that the entire city was to be devoted to the Lord (Josh. 6:17-18). The gold, silver, vessels of bronze and iron were to be put into the treasury of the house of the Lord (Josh. 6:19,24). Everything else was to be burned and destroyed. Israel was to keep nothing for themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately, Israel’s rejoicing from their victory would be short-lived. “The people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the Lord burned against the people of Israel” (Joshua 7:1).</p><p>Achan, whose name means “troubler,” failed to keep the command concerning the devoted things in Jericho. Due to Achan’s sin the entire army was defeated in their next campaign at Ai. The enemy killed thirty-six Hebrew soldiers. This was Israel’s only military defeat in the Promised Land.</p><p>Joshua brought Achan and his family to the valley of Achor, which also means “trouble.” It was at Achor that judgment would be carried out. Achan and his family were stoned and burned in the Valley of Achor. It was there in that dreaded valley they built a memorial to sin and judgment (Josh. 7:25-26).</p><p>Hundreds of years later the prophet Hosea would love and marry a prostitute (Hos.1:2). Despite her unfaithfulness, he loved her still (Hos.3:1-2). The prophet was a picture of God, and the prostitute was a picture of Israel. The Lord speaking through Hosea says: “Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. And there I will give her her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth, as at the time when she came out of the land of Egypt” (Hos. 2:14–15).</p><p>In the Valley of Achor there would be a door of hope. There in the valley of condemnation the Lord would speak words of allurement to those who are guilty of sin. No longer would that valley be a memorial for judgment, but instead it would be a memorial of hope.</p><p>Dear reader, Jesus is the door of hope in the Valley of Achor. Jesus Christ took our judgment of sin, that we may enter the door of hope. Will you enter in?</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 7-11	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-7-11.png
537	2020-03-12 17:01:28	\N	\N	\N	<p>Moses was laid to rest on Nebo’s lonely mountain. Israel’s new leader, Joshua, stood on top of the mountain and looked toward Canaan. Israel’s time to take possession of the Promised Land had come. Moses had previously sent twelve men to spy out Canaan (Num. 13:1-3). Out of the twelve men, only Joshua and Caleb believed they could take possession (Num. 14:6-9). That may be why Joshua only sent two men to spy out the land this time (Josh. 2:1).</p><p>The city of Jericho would be Israel’s first conquest. Jericho’s inhabitants were already in fear of Israel by the time the spies entered the city. Word reached the king that two strange men entered the city, and were hiding in one of the harlot’s homes.</p><p>It was true, the two spies were at Rahab the harlot’s house. Rahab hid the two spies from the king’s men. Rahab told the spies, “I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you” (Josh. 2:9). Rahab proclaimed, “for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath” (Josh. 2:12). What a confession of faith! Her faith would later be mentioned in James’ epistle and the letter to the Hebrews (Jas. 2:25; Heb. 11:31). Rahab requested that she and her family be spared once Israel encroached Jericho. The two spies agreed, but requested that she hang a scarlet thread from her home’s window.</p><p>The spies and Joshua kept their word, and Rahab and her family were saved during the attack (Josh. 6:17,22-23,25). Had it not been for Rahab’s faith, and the scarlet thread floating in the breeze, she and her family would have been lost. From that moment she and her family dwelt with the people of Israel. We will read later how Rahab married a man by the name of Salmon and how she was included in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (Matt. 1:5).</p><p>The scarlet thread waving from Rahab’s window, which saved her and her household, reminds us of Calvary’s cross. The two spies promised if she would hang that from her window, she and her family would be spared. Rahab believed the promise and she was saved. Beloved, will you put your faith in Jesus Christ? Will you look to His scarlet blood that was shed for you and me? Put your trust in Him, and you too will be saved.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 2-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-2-6.png
538	2020-03-11 21:18:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>Joshua is one of the great characters of the Old Testament. His original name was Hoshea, which means “salvation,” but Moses changed it to Joshua, which means “Jehovah is salvation” (Num. 13:8,16). We might add that the Greek form of Joshua is Jesus (Matt. 1:21). This is significant in the drama of redemption. Moses, representative of the Law, couldn’t bring Israel into Canaan, the Promised Land. Joshua, representative of Jesus Christ, fulfilled God’s promises of bringing God’s people into the Promised Land (Heb. 4:8).</p><p>Scripture labels Joshua as Moses’ assistant (Josh. 1:1). Joshua served an important role during the wilderness wandering, assisting Israel’s great leader. Though he was Moses’ assistant, he was also a man of war. For it was Joshua who victoriously led the armies of Israel against Amalek (Ex. 17:9).</p><p>In addition to being a great warrior, Joshua was also a man of God. He accompanied Moses up Mount Sinai, where the glory of the Lord dwelt (Ex. 24:13-16). This must be where Joshua learned from Moses to linger in the presence of God. Before the erection of the Tabernacle, Joshua would make frequent trips to the tent of meeting where he would linger even after Moses’ departure (Ex. 33:7-11). Scripture also identifies Joshua as a man in whom is the Spirit (Num. 27:18). Needless to say, Joshua was a man of prayer, courage, faith, and leadership.</p><p>The book of Joshua records the children of Israel, under the leadership of Joshua, taking possession of the Promised Land. Speaking of the Promised Land, we should note at the outset, that Canaan is not representative of heaven. Bible commentator, Sidlow Baxter, notes, “Canaan was a place of conquest through conflict. There had been little fighting during the wilderness years, but as soon as Canaan was entered Israel must draw the sword. Enemies must be destroyed. Israel must fight. How then can Canaan typify the calm restfulness of the ultimate inheritance in heaven?” Baxter further noted that Canaan was representative of the Christian’s present position and possession in Christ.</p><p>As great as Joshua was, there was a greater Joshua to come. Joshua was able to help Israel see many of God’s promises with the patriarchs fulfilled. Jesus, on the other hand, fulfilled all of God’s promises (2 Cor. 1:19-20). Joshua was Israel’s military leader, leading them to victory. Jesus, on the other hand, is the Captain of our Salvation (Heb. 2:10). The Spirit of the Lord dwelt within Joshua. Jesus, on the other hand, was God manifest in flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).</p><p>Beloved, let us read the book of Joshua seeing the greatness of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Joshua 1	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Joshua-1.png
539	2020-03-10 21:55:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>We have come to the conclusion of the Pentateuch and Moses’ life. From being drawn from the reeds of the Nile River to the plagues in Egypt to leading Israel through the wilderness, Moses’ life has been a thrilling adventure. The renowned preacher, DL Moody, said, “Moses spent forty years thinking he was somebody; forty years learning he was nobody; and forty years discovering what God can do with a nobody.”</p><p>The last chapter of Deuteronomy gives us a short summary of Moses’ life. He died at the age of 120, but his eyes were not dim, and he was as strong as ever (Deut. 34:7). Moses’ life can be summed up like this: “And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel” (Deut. 34:10–12).</p><p>Moses stood before Pharaoh and demanded for Israel to be set free. He stood before Aaron and Levites and anointed them to be priests in Israel. He stood before his detractors and defended God’s laws. While Moses stood before many great people, he only bowed before his Lord. And because of that he was able to know the Lord face to face.</p><p>One of the greatest lessons we can learn from the life of Moses is that he had a relationship with the Lord. He was able to do so many extraordinary things because he had an extraordinary relationship with God. Beloved, that is the attribute of Moses that we should seek to attain the most.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 33-34	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-33-34.png
540	2020-03-09 15:54:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>For forty years the people of Israel wandered the wilderness. The Lord, during that span of time, graciously provided for their every need. He provided water when they were thirsty, and manna when they were hungry. Furthermore, their shoes and clothes didn’t wear out despite the conditions of the environment, and length of time (Deut. 29:5).</p><p>There was just one problem with all of this: “Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; Then he forsook God which made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation” (Deut. 32:15). Israel was fat with blessings! Their fatness, made possible by God, led to their downfall. They were so fat with blessings that they failed to possess the Promised Land and forsook the Lord. In other words, they were too fat for faith. In all of Israel’s well-being they forgot their God.</p><p>Many of us in the church are too fat for faith. We have become fat from the blessings of God, leaving little to no room for Him in our lives. When you’re too fat for faith it’s easy to complain and murmur. It becomes easy to criticize anything in the church, when you’re too fat for faith. If we aren’t careful we will make the blessings our god, and forsake the True God. The blessings are just that- blessings. The substance of our faith is God, not His blessings.</p><p>Jesus said, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Mt. 6:33). Beloved, it’s important that we don’t reverse the order to keep ourselves from getting too fat for faith. Seek Him first, and all the other things will be added unto you.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 30-32	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-30-32.png
541	2020-03-07 23:14:11	\N	\N	\N	<p>The day when Israel took possession of the Promised Land quickly approached. Moses commanded that Israel be gathered at Shechem’s valley between Mount Ebal and Gerizim when that day finally came. At Mount Ebal the people were to set up large stones, coat them with plaster, and inscribe the entire Law upon them (Deut. 27:2-4). In addition to the stones with the Law inscribed, they were to erect an altar made of stones in order to offer burnt offerings, and sacrifices peace offerings to the Lord (Deut. 27:4-8).</p><p>What’s more, half of the tribes of Israel were to stand upon Mount Ebal and pronounce curses for disobeying the Law. The other half were to stand upon Mount Gerizim and pronounce blessings for obeying the Law (Deut. 11:29-32; 27:11-26). The people were to shout “amen” after each curse and blessing were pronounced.</p><p>In Genesis there were two trees in Eden: The Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. One tree symbolized life, and the other symbolized death. Adam could cling to the Tree of Life and live, or eat from the other and die. Adam, like the rest of his offspring, chose the wrong tree. Even today man stands in the valley of decision between curses and blessings. You could choose to obey God’s commands and live, or disobey His commands and die.</p><p>Joshua, many years later, stood in the valley between Mount Ebal and Gerizim and said, “choose you this day whom you will serve” (Jos. 24:15)! The choice is yours. Will you choose to serve the Lord and receive His blessings? Or will you choose your own way and receive His curses?

542	2020-03-06 22:59:05	\N	\N	\N	<p>The children of Israel were a privileged people. They were the only nation that could claim to be the people of God. God made provision for Gentiles to become Hebrews, if they were willing to submit to circumcision (Ex. 12:48). There was, however, a distinction between living as a Hebrew and worshiping as a Hebrew. God had the right to determine who would enter the congregation of His holy people.</p><p>Bible commentator Eugene Merrill writes concerning Deuteronomy 23:1, “The ‘congregation’ refers here to the formal gathering of the Lord’s people as a community at festival occasions and other times of public worship and not to the nation of Israel as such.”</p><p>Deuteronomy 23:1-8 categorizes those who were to be excluded from the congregation of Israel. Men who had been emasculated were prohibited (23:1); illegitimate children couldn’t be part of the congregation (23:2); Ammonites and Moabites were to be excluded for up to ten generations (23:3-6); and only after three generation could Edomites and Egyptians be authorized to enter (23:7-8). The privilege of being part of the congregation of Israel was limited to those who had been born an Israelite.</p><p>Thankfully, today, anyone can be part of God’s people! All you have to do is submit to the Lord Jesus Christ be born again of the water and Spirit (Jn. 3:3-8). Your genealogy doesn’t disqualify you. Your economic situation doesn’t exclude you. Your past mistakes don’t prohibit you. The color of your skin, nor your ethnicity precludes you. The apostle Paul said it this way, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ&#8217;s, then are ye Abraham&#8217;s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Gal. 3:28-29).</p><p>Dear reader, come enter the congregation and worship the Lord Jesus Christ freely!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 23-26	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-23-26.png
543	2020-03-06 01:11:50	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Lord included punishments for those who broke His laws. The Old Testament Law provided three types of punishment: the death penalty for serious public sins against life, religion and the family; ‘cutting-off’ for grave private sins; and restoration for property offenses.</p><p>Stoning seems to be the most common form of the death penalty in the Old Testament. We read in Deuteronomy 21:22-23, however, about hanging a criminal from a tree. The hanging of criminals in a public place was practiced by both Israelites and their Gentile neighbors (Josh. 8:23,29; Esth. 2:23; 5:14). This public humiliation of hanging a criminal may have served as a warning to the community of the dire consequences of committing certain crimes.</p><p>Moses adds, “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance” (Deut. 21:23). The criminal hanged on a tree was considered cursed of God. The body wasn’t to be left upon the tree all night, but was to be buried the same day.</p><p>This passage has theological and spiritual significance for the New Testament believer. The apostle Paul cited this very text when he wrote that Jesus redeemed us from the curse of the Law: “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree” (Gal. 3:13). The prophet Isaiah wrote, “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (Isa. 53:4).</p><p>Jesus was crucified upon Calvary’s tree, and became the curse for you me. Let the cross of Christ serve as an awful reminder of sin’s curse, and Christ’s love.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 20-22	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-20-22.png
544	2020-03-04 18:05:48	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Lord knew there would be a day when Israel would desire to have a king rule over them (1 Sam. 8:4-22). With that in mind, the Lord gave Israel certain requirements for their future king (Deut. 17:14-20). The requirements of the king have great spiritual significance. Let’s take a closer look at a few them.</p><p>First, the king must be chosen of the Lord. Israel wasn’t to choose some random man to be their king. Only the Lord would be able to chose and ordain their would-be leader. Friends, don’t allow unqualified people to speak into your life. God has set forth godly principles for leaders. Only allow spiritually qualified people to lead you.</p><p>Second, the king must be a Hebrew, and not a stranger. It was important that Israel’s king be one of their own. A stranger wouldn’t know their God or His laws. Furthermore, a stranger wouldn’t understand their lifestyle. Too many people allow strange things into their lives. This is due to the fact that they allow strange people to influence them. Follow people who know your God, and know His Word.</p><p>Another command for kings I’d like to look at concerns the king not acquiring horses. What a strange command! Are horses dangerous? Are horses considered evil? Why in the world would God command such a requirement? The answer is right before us: “He must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to acquire horses, since the Lord has said to you, ‘You shall never return that way again’&#8221; (Deut. 17:16). The issue wasn’t with horses, the problem was where you had to go in order to acquire one! Egypt, at that time, was the only place you could buy a horse. The Lord had freed Israel from Egypt, and He didn’t want them going back. Not even for a horse!</p><p>Beloved, avoid the world at all costs. If the Lord delivered you from sin and the world, then you don’t have any reason to go back to it. Even if it’s for something as insignificant as a horse.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 17-19	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-17-19.png
545	2020-03-04 02:24:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>A Hebrew man could sell himself as a slave to pay any debt (Ex. 21:1-6; Lev. 25:39-45; Deut. 15:12-18). This type of voluntary slavery shouldn’t be confused with forced slavery, or the slavery of the Antebellum period. Moses said that such slaves were to be released after six years of service. In order for the newly freed slave to start a new life, the master was to give them ample provision.</p><p>In some cases a slave may feel happy to stay with his master indefinitely, and decide not to leave. Many Hebrew slaves were treated like family members, such as Abraham’s servant Eliezer (Gen. 24:2-67). The master would ceremonially pierce the ear of the slave as part of the procedure of staying. This piercing marked the slave as being completely committed to his master.</p><p>This is a wonderful picture of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul said, “He made Himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross” (Php. 2:7-8). Jesus was God in flesh, but He willingly submitted Himself to servanthood. In doing so, He was pierced for our transgressions (Isa. 53:5).</p><p>Jesus became a servant, so He could free us from the slavery of sin. Jesus became what He wasn’t, so we could become what we weren’t. Now that we are free from sin, we willingly become His servants. Like the apostle Paul, we bear in our body the marks of our Master, the Lord Jesus Christ (Gal. 6:17).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 14-16	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-14-16.png
546	2020-03-02 17:21:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Lord had given specific instructions concerning Israel’s worship. For instance, the Tabernacle was the ordained place of worship (Deut. 12:5;18). Upon entering the Promised Land, Israel wasn’t to forsake God’s instructions and adopt the Canaanite’s way of worship. Therefore, the Lord told them to tear down the Canaanite’s altars, pillars, and idols (Deut. 12:3).</p><p>Furthermore, the central location of the Tabernacle fostered unity and gave focus to the religious life of Israel. Strange worship was forbidden and to be shunned. Israel’s worship, and way of life were to be distinct. Any attempts to worship or to behave like heathen nations would lead to Israel’s demise.</p><p>One of the differences between the Old and New Testament is that the Old Testament places emphasis on a place, notably the Tabernacle. The New Testament, on the other hand, places emphasis upon a person, namely Jesus Christ. The person and work of Jesus Christ superseded the place of the Old Testament. Worship in the Old Testament was restricted to the Tabernacle and eventually the Temple. Jesus replaces the divine place, with His divine presence.</p><p>Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well, “The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship Him in spirit and in truth” (Jn. 4:23-24).</p><p>Worship of Jesus isn’t limited to a place. You can worship Him wherever you are. Just because we can worship Christ whenever, and wherever we desire, does not mean that we can worship Him haphazardly. Jesus said we must worship Him in spirit and in truth. Only those who have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and who obey the truth of God’s Word, can properly worship Him.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 11-13	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-11-13.png
547	2020-03-01 22:44:39	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Why did the Lord choose Israel? You might have asked that question a few times since we read of their departure from Egypt. Today’s reading gives us the answer to this question.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>God didn’t choose Israel because they had the biggest population (Deut. 7:7). They were larger nations that had been around a lot longer too. Neither did Israel have their own land to dwell. Since Abraham they had only be sojourners in other people’s territory.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t because of Israel’s righteousness or the uprightness of their heart that the Lord chose them (Deut. 9:4-5). Israel’s heart was as hard as the chains that bound them in Egypt. They wandered the wilderness murmuring for forty years. How many times did Moses have to intercede on their behalf? How many times did the Lord have to chasten them? Israel broke the commandments before Moses even had time to come down the mountain (Deut. 9:12). In only forty days time they had forgotten who had brought them out of Egypt, and were worshiping a golden calf (Deut. 9:13-16). So it couldn’t have been their righteous behavior that caused the Lord to choose them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So why did God choose Israel? He chose them out of His sovereign will and steadfast love. Even though Israel was the fewest in number, God chose them to be His treasured possession. He set His love upon them regardless of their size and condition of their hearts (Deut. 7:7-8).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we must ask, “Why did God choose you or me?” He didn’t choose us because we were worthy. He didn’t choose us because we were better than someone else. He didn’t choose us because we deserved it. We weren’t saved by our works of righteousness (Titus 3:5). Our righteousness is as filthy rags (Isa. 64:6). If anything, none of us deserved this wonderful salvation. God loved us in spite of our failures and misgivings. He loved us in spite of our hard and stubborn hearts. He loved us when we were unlovable.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, the next time we ask why God chose Israel, remember why He chose us.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 7-10	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-deuteronomy-4-6.png
548	2020-02-29 23:02:39	\N	\N	\N	<p>“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord” (Deut. 6:4). This command is the orthodox Jew’s confession of faith. Israel was to confess there was only one God, and they were to pledge their lives only to Him (Deut. 6:5). Israel wasn’t to make any graven images to worship (Deut. 4:15-20). Israel’s singular devotion was to be for God alone, not to something that they had created. When they stood at the foot of Mt. Sinai, they didn’t see any image of God, rather they only heard His voice, and seen His power (Deut. 4:33-36). Unlike all of the other religions that Israel would encounter, their God couldn’t be seen, but He could speak and perform wonders (Deut. 4:27-28; 5:22-24).</p><p>Jesus said this was the first and greatest commandment (Mt. 22:36; Mk. 12:18). Jesus quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 also said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (Mt. 22:37). Pure devotion to God involves your heart, soul, and mind. In essence, this is the entirety of our lives. One cannot love God entirely without also loving God’s Laws. We must learn to delight in God’s Law in the inner man (Rom. 7:22). We should hide the Word of God in our hearts that we don’t sin against Him (Ps. 119:11). We must meditate upon His Word day and night (Ps. 1:2). Finally, we must never forget the Word of God, so our souls never slip from our hands (Ps. 119:109).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-4-6.png
549	2020-02-28 16:20:50	\N	\N	\N	<p>The book of Deuteronomy is the fifth and final book of the Pentateuch. The original name given to this book was “These are the words” which was taken from the first verse (Deut. 1:1). The name Deuteronomy is made up of two Greek words “deuteros” and “nomos” mean “Second Law” when put together. The reasoning behind the name Deuteronomy is due to Moses repeating the Law to the new generation as they approached the Promised Land.</p><p>The generation that was brought out of Egypt was dead. The new generation was now ready to take possession of the Promised Land. For that reason Moses recounted the previous generation’s exploits and failures (Num. 1-3). Their failures would serve as a reminder to the new generation. God remained faithful despite the previous generation’s unfaithfulness. Therefore, the purpose of Deuteronomy is to call the new generation to faithfulness.</p><p>Furthermore, Israel’s faithfulness was contingent upon their obedience to the Law. Moses didn’t give them a new Law, or an updated Law, rather the new generation was given the original Law. It wasn’t the Law that failed the previous generation; it was the previous generation that failed to obey the Law (Heb. 3:16-19). Their obedience to the Law needed to be mixed with faith (Heb. 4:2). Their lack of faith led to their failure to take possession of the Promised Land. The Lord, and Moses, weren’t going to allow another generation to die in the wilderness, thus the Law is given a second time.</p><p>We see this same principle applied in the New Testament. The apostle Paul wrote to Timothy, “Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also” (2 Tim. 2:1-2). The success of the Church is dependent upon teaching the next generation the Word of God. If we fail to teach them the Bible, then we can’t be surprised if they perpetually wander the wilderness of the world.</p><p>We should be thankful for those who have taught us the Word of God. I’m thankful for faithful pastors who have preached the Bible to me. I’m grateful for Sunday School teachers who patiently taught the Bible to me. I’m indebted to leaders who have invested in my life and ministry. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Deuteronomy 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Deuteronomy-1-3.png
550	2020-02-27 14:07:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Levites weren’t allowed to own any land in Canaan, because the Lord was their portion (Deut. 10:9). For this reason Israel was to designate specific cities for the Levites to live in (Num. 35:1-5). Those six cities were assigned to be “cities of refuge.” If an Israelite or stranger unintentionally killed a person, then the “manslayer” could flee to the nearest city of refuge. The manslayer would be safe if the victim’s family wanted to exact revenge. The manslayer would stand trial before the elders of the city to judge whether or not he was guilty or innocent. If found guilty, he would be turned over to the avenger of blood, and put to death. If the death was judged to be inadvertent, then the manslayer would have to remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. The manslayer was safe as long as he remained in the city of refuge. However, if he were to take one step out of the city, the avenger of blood would be free to kill him.</p><p>We see in the cities of refuge wonderful types and shadows. The Law of God is the avenger of blood chasing after the sinner (Rom. 7:10; 2 Cor. 3:7). The penalty for transgression of the Law is death (Rom. 6:23). The only hope for the sinner is to flee to Jesus Christ, the refuge from sin and death (Heb. 6:18). As long as the sinner remains in Christ, he will be safe from the avenger of blood (Heb. 6:4-8). Jesus Christ, thankfully, is a High Priest that ever liveth (Heb. 6:19-20).</p><p>Dear reader, have you sinned against God’s Law? Run to Christ, our refuge! The cities of refuge were for Hebrews and strangers alike (Num. 35:15). Refuge from sin and death is available for all people. Run to Him, and be saved.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 35-36	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-35-36.png
551	2020-02-25 19:08:26	\N	\N	\N	<p>Taking possession of the Promised Land wasn’t going to be easy for Israel. They were going to have to drive out all the inhabitants of the land (Ex. 23:20-33). Not only were they to drive the inhabitants out, they would also need to destroy any semblance of the people’s religions and lifestyles. The Lord said, &#8220;destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places” (Num. 33:52). Israel had shown a fondness for the Egyptian way of life, and Baal worship during their wildness wanderings. Therefore, the Lord was giving them commands to destroy anything that might entice them to forsake their first love.</p><p>If Israel allowed the inhabitants of Canaan to stay, and indulged their way of life, it would be to their disadvantage. The Lord warned them, “But if you fail to drive out the people who live in the land, those who remain will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will harass you in the land where you live.” (Num. 33:55 NLT).</p><p>Splinters, thorns, and harassment. That’s exactly what sin will do to us if we fail to conquer it. Have you ever tried to remove a splinter? Splinters can be small but painful. Attempting to remove a splinter takes a lot of effort. No matter the size of the sin, it will injure and prove to be difficult to remove. My childhood home had thorn bushes right near my basketball goal. One careless move and I’d get cut while retrieving my basketball. Sin is like a thorn bush, one careless thought or action could lead to a painful wound. I wasn’t the biggest kid in my class when I was in school. Needless to say, I was the older and bigger kid’s target for harassment some days. If you don’t take a stand against a bully, you’ll always be their victim. If sin isn’t dealt with, it will grow and harass your conscience.</p><p>Beloved, we can’t allow sin to inhabit our lives. The apostle Paul said we are to put to death the works of the flesh (Rom. 8:13; Col. 3:5-9; Gal. 5:24; 6:14; 1 Cor. 9:27). We can only drive out the inhabitant of sin through the Holy Spirit, who works with us towards our sanctification (Gal. 5:16).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 33-34	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-33-34.png
552	2020-02-24 23:18:56	\N	\N	\N	<p>Between the conquest of Sihon and Og (Num. 21:21-35) and crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and a portion of Manasseh requested to stay in the land east of the Jordan. The land was suitable for pasturing large herds and and flocks (Num. 32:1).</p><p>Moses wasn’t pleased with their request. Moses asked, &#8220;Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?” Moses feared the Lord would be angered at their request to not cross over the Jordan River (Num. 32:6-15). The leaders of the tribes promised to fight alongside the rest of Israel during the Canaanite conquest, followed by simply going back to inhabit their desired land (Num. 32:17).</p><p>Moses granted their request, but this wouldn’t be their only example of compromise. Once Israel acquired Canaan, these three tribes went back over the Jordan River and built their own altar. Like their previous excuse of staying on the other side of the Jordan River, they justified building a replica of God’s place of worship (Josh. 22:10-34).</p><p>Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh’s compromise would prove to be detrimental to their future. The land in which these three tribes inhabited were in close proximity to several of Israel’s adversaries: Moab, Edom, and Ammon. These antagonist’s way of life seemed to always be a thorn in the flesh to Israel (1 Chr. 5:25). As a result of their compromising, the Assyrians eventually took them into captivity (1 Chr. 5:26).</p><p>Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh settled for less when they inhabited the land east of the Jordan River. Their decision made them vulnerable to temptation and attack. Dear reader, whether we concede God’s promises; justify our wrong desires; or compromise biblical truth, we make ourselves vulnerable to temptation, and spiritual attacks.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 31-32	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-31-32.png
553	2020-02-23 23:02:08	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Now that the previous generation had died, it was time to start instructing the new generation. The Lord, through Moses, began to teach the new generation concerning the daily, monthly, and yearly offerings (Num. 28-29). The Hebrew calendar centered around the worship of Jehovah. A new generation needed a new commitment, and it was going to begin with a reminder of God’s preferred methods of worship.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These offerings had already been given and outlined at Mt. Sinai. Yes, the new generation needed a new commitment, but their commitment was going to be based upon old laws. There was nothing antiquated with the Passover, the Day of Atonement, or the Feast of Tabernacles. God wasn’t going to adjust His laws to fit a younger generation. What God had established at Mt. Sinai was still going to be effective in the wilderness, and eventually in the Promised Land.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Considering that we have read about these laws and offerings in previous books and chapters, they are still relevant. The apostle Peter wrote, “Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance” (2 Pt. 1:13). The church will never outgrow biblical teaching. We need reminded of God’s Word no matter the generation, or the era in which the church resides. Doctrine never expires, or grows stale. But doctrine can be forgotten and neglected. Let us be stirred up to be reminded of the glorious truths found in Scripture. Let us be stirred up to teach the next generation the blessed gospel of Jesus Christ!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 28-30	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-14-15-6.png
554	2020-02-22 22:38:37	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>The generation of Hebrews that escaped Egypt died in the wilderness, never to possess what they left for. They left behind a legacy of murmuring, complaining, and unbelief. If their children were to visit their graves, they’d have to go back to the wilderness to pay their respects. On their graves it would be written, “Lost in the wilderness” (Num. 26:65). The wilderness claimed an entire generation. They were a generation of unclaimed promises and possessions. All of the miracles, all of the answered prayers, all of the victories weren’t enough to convince them to claim God’s promises. What a poor example they left their children.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>God had another generation in spite of the previous generation’s failings. Numbers 26 gives the census of the new generation. This would be the generation that would have faith in God. This would be the generation that would claim God’s promises.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What example are you giving the next generation? Does the next generation hear you complaining, and murmuring? Does the next generation see your unbelief, and rebellion? Don’t let the next generation visit your graves of regret. On the other hand, you can’t let a previous generation’s poor example paralyze your faith and progress. You must take responsibility for your own life. Just because your family may have given you a less than stellar example of living for God, doesn’t mean you can’t claim what God has promised.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 26-27	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-14-15-5.png
555	2020-02-21 23:34:27	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>The king of Moab, Balak, grew in fear as he beheld the large Hebrew population. Moab, apparently, didn’t have a large enough army to engage Israel in battle. Balak resorted to hiring a soothsayer to curse them. Balak sent dignitaries from Moab and Midian to a man named Balaam. Balaam operated in familiar spirits, and offered his services of blessing and cursing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Balaam is a mysterious figure. He practiced divination using omens (Num. 24:1). On the other hand, he also consulted the Lord. Before he would accept Balak’s offer of cursing Israel, Balaam asked the Lord’s permission (Num. 22:8). The Lord commanded Balaam not to go, for Israel was not to be cursed. Not to be denied, Balak sent more dignitaries, and asked Balaam to come again.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is where Balaam’s story goes off the rails. Knowing God’s answer the first time, he asked again. The Lord relented and told him to only speak what He told him to. Balaam saddled his donkey and headed towards Moab. After a strange encounter with an angel, and his speaking donkey, Balaam continued toward Moab. Balaam blessed Israel, saying exactly what the Lord told him, while in Balak’s presence. Balaam didn’t curse Israel, he did something more diabolical instead. Balaam showed Balak how to tempt Israel with idolatry and fornication (Num. 25:1-9; 31:16). Israel couldn’t be cursed by others, but they had the capability of cursing themselves with their own actions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Balaam’s life can be summed up with one Scripture: “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways” (Jam. 1:8). Balaam could consult omens and converse with Jehovah. He entertained familiar spirits, and offered to speak on behalf of God. In essence, Balaam could speak for God, but wouldn’t live for God. Balaam died a cursed man (Num. 31:8).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Dear reader, Balaam should serve as a warning to us. Too many people want to entertain evil spirits, while saying they love the Lord. But they are as unstable as Balaam. You can’t have one foot in the world, and one foot in the church. Attempting to live in these two worlds will cause you to lose your footing, end up cursed.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 23-25	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-14-15-4.png

Israel, again, bemoans the wilderness and their food (Num. 21:4-5). The Lord, without warning, sent fiery serpents into the camp. As the snakes began to bite the people they cried out and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us” (Num. 21:7).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Lord gave an answer for the snake-bitten people. Moses was to make a fiery serpent made of brass, place it on a pole, and have the people simply look at it and they would live. All they had to do was look upon the very thing that was killing them, and they would live.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus referred to this event and said, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life” (Jn. 3:14-15). Something far worse than fiery serpents was killing us, and that was sin. For the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). The answer for our plight was Christ. Jesus, who knew no sin, became sin for us and was lifted up from the earth (2 Cor. 5:21). The apostle Peter said, “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed” (1 Pt. 2:24).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, we must look upon Him and live. Look upon Him who bore our sins, and live! Look upon Him who bore our guilt, and live! Look upon Him who carried our shame, and live! Look upon Him who died and was raised from the dead, and live! Look upon Him and live!

Now that the Tabernacle had been erected, Israel was bringing offerings in support of the ministry and the maintenance of the Tabernacle (Num. 7:1-2).</p><p>Numbers chapter 7 is the longest chapter in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible).The twelve tribes of Israel, represented by heads of each tribe, brought offerings in six covered wagons drawn by two oxen each. A total of 240 animals, 2400 shekels of silver, and 120 shekels of gold were offered as gifts to the Lord. The chapter records the same exact offering given by each respective tribe.<br />What may look like a long boring chapter, covering each tribe’s offering, actually offers the valuable lesson that God takes record of everything we give.</p><p>The Lord takes record when you give of your time (Eph. 5:15-16). The Lord takes record when you give of your talents (Ecc. 9:10). The Lord takes record when you give Him thanks (Ps. 30:12; 35:18). The Lord takes record when you give your tithe and offerings (Mal. 3:8-11). The Lord has a heavenly register with your name in it, and He is taking account of all that you give (Lk. 10:20; 1 Cor. 3:8; Php. 4:3).</p><p>Our Savior gave His life for us (Matt. 20:28; Jn. 3:16). The least we could do is give of our lives and abundance. The Lord said it best, “It is more blessed to give, than to receive” (Acts. 20:35).

Consequently, rest was tied to the promises of God with Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rest finds it true fulfillment in the New Testament. Jesus promises rest to the weary (Mt. 11:28-30). Disobedience and unbelief kept Israel from receiving this rest. New Testament believers receive this rest due to their faith in Jesus Christ (Heb. 3:7-4:10).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What does this have to do with the death of Miriam and Aaron, and Moses’ failure? Moses wasn’t allowed to lead Israel into their promised rest. Moses represents the Law, and the Law could never bring us into God’s rest. Miriam died in the wilderness, never to enter the Promised Land. Miriam represents the Prophets (Ex. 15:20), and the prophets could never bring us into God’s rest. Aaron was buried in a mountain in the wilderness, just short of the Promised Land. Aaron represents the Priesthood, and the Priesthood could never bring us into God’s promises.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moses, Aaron, and Miriam wouldn’t lead Israel into the Promised Land, that role was reserved for Joshua, whose name means “Jehovah is Salvation.” Beloved, the Law, Prophets, and Priesthood could never effectuate rest for our souls, that could only be accomplished by Jesus, whose name means “Jehovah is Salvation.” Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets (Mt. 5:17), and He is a greater High Priest than Aaron (Heb. 5:1-6; 7:24).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Put your faith in Jesus, and find rest for your souls.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 18-20	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-14-15-2.png
558	2020-02-18 17:17:48	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Korah was from the tribe of Kohath. The Kohathites were responsible for carrying the sacred furniture from the Tabernacle. Such a solemn task came with great responsibility. Though the Kohathites were Levites, they were different from the Aaronic priesthood, which included offering sacrifices.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Korah, unfortunately, thought he and some of the other Levites should have more responsibility than simply carrying holy furniture. Korah influenced two hundred and fifty men of renown and rebelled against Moses and Aaron. Korah said to Moses and Aaron, “Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord” (Num. 16:3)?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than be satisfied with their own calling and responsibility, Korah and his cohorts wanted the priesthood too. Jude, in his New Testament epistle, likened Korah’s actions to the false teachers, and considered what he done to be “gainsaying” (Jude 1:4-11). The word “gainsaying” means to be “rebellious.” Korah’s desire to be part of the priesthood was rebellion in God’s eyes. Korah was rebelling against his God-given calling.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moses and Aaron didn’t ordain themselves as priests, it was God who placed them into those holy positions (Heb. 5:4). Accordingly, God has placed certain people into positions of authority within the church (Rom. 13:1-7;1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11-12). Those that would attempt to usurp God’s order of hierarchy do this to their own damnation. Likewise, those who believe they don’t need spiritual overseers seek to be their own priests.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What is remarkable about Korah’s rebellion is that he and his tribe were doing things no one else in Israel was allowed to do. Other than Aaron, they were the only ones allowed to come into such close proximity to the holy things of the Tabernacle. God’s glory was upon their shoulders and in their hands. In Korah’s mind that just wasn’t enough. In the end it was God’s authority that prevailed. God will not be challenged or questioned.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, the best way to honor God is to obey His commands, follow His anointed leadership, and fulfill your calling.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Number 16-17	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-14-15-1.png
559	2020-02-17 14:51:17	\N	\N	\N	<p>Scripture describes the Promised Land as a land “flowing with milk and honey” at least nineteen time (Lev. 26:3–12; Num. 13:23, 28; 14:7; 24:3; Deut. 6:3; 11:9; 26:9, 15; 27:3; 28:2–7, 11–12; 31:20). Canaan didn’t have rivers of milk and ravines filled with honey. Rather, this was a hyperbolic way of describing the rich abundance of the land of Canaan. The twelve spies, who inspected the Promised Land, testified to the fact that it was in fact a land flowing with milk and honey (Num. 13:27). They even brought one cluster of grapes that had to be carried by two men (Num. 13:23)!</p><p>Possibly the spies witnessed that cattle and goats produced more milk in areas abundant with forage. Honey, in the biblical period, was not a cultivated product. Honey was associated with nonagricultural areas that were covered with wild vegetation. The Promised Land had the agricultural capability to produce what Israel worked for, and the capability of producing natural resources. In other words, the land would produce milk if they worked for it, and it would naturally produce honey if they cared for it.</p><p>The twelve spies witnessed the fulfillment of God’s promises. The Promised Land was everything that God promised it would be. But rather than go and posses Canaan, they were terrified of the giants that inhabited the land. Their fear paralyzed their faith. Despite the land flowing with milk and honey, they wanted to go back to Egypt (Num. 14:3-4).</p><p>Unfortunately this happens in the church today. People are freed from their bondage of sin, and at the first sight of trouble they want to go back to the world. Or, when they realize that living for God requires work and effort, they would would rather go back and be a slave to sin.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, living for the Lord is far greater than being a slave to sin. Don’t go back to the world. Don’t forsake God’s promises. Like the cluster of grapes being carried by two men, look at the blessings that others have witnessed and experienced. Those blessings are greater than anything that the world has ever offered.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 14-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-14-15.png
560	2020-02-17 04:11:14	\N	\N	\N	<p>Let’s recount all that has happened to Israel thus far. God had freed them from Egypt’s bondage with the shed blood of a lamb. They crossed over the Red Sea on dry ground when the Egyptians pursued them. When they were thirsty, God provided water in the desert. Their hunger was abated when the Lord gave them manna from heaven. The Lord graciously entered into a covenant with them, and gave them the Law. God decided to dwell among them through the Tabernacle. Furthermore, in the two years since they left Egypt, the Lord had provided everything they had need of.</p><p>Numbers 11-13 are three of the saddest chapters in Numbers, for the people had forgotten all of the blessings listed above. First, the people complained (Num. 11:1). What were they complaining about? Scripture doesn’t answer that question. It was bad enough, however, that the Lord’s anger was kindled and fire consumed them. Second, as if people being burned up with fire wasn’t enough, Israel complained about not having any meat to eat. Their memories forgot about the beatings in Egypt, but could remember the fish they ate in Egypt (Num. 11:5). The people complained about eating manna, to the point that they cried. Moses grew so tired of their constant complaining, that he criticized the people to the Lord (Num. 11:10-13).</p><p>Next, Moses’ brother and sister spake against him (Num. 12:1). Keep in mind, this is song-singing, and tambourine-shaking Miriam (Ex. 15:20-21). This is animal-sacrificing, holy place-dwelling Aaron. The same Aaron whose two sons were killed by the Lord for offering strange fire (Lev. 10:1-2). Here they were talking bad about their brother, Moses. God strikes Miriam with leprosy, but has mercy upon her after Moses prays for her (Num. 12:13).</p><p>You might be led to believe that things could get better. You’d be wrong. God extended mercy to Israel, and was ready to take them into Canaan, the Promised Land. Yes, the land of flowing milk and honey. Each tribe was to send a representative to spy out the land. And guess what? It’s everything God promised, and everything that they didn’t deserve. Twelve spies check out the land, and only two have a good report. Ten spies are overwhelmed with the sight of giants. Israel votes to not possess the Promised Land.</p><p>The Lord extended mercy time and time again to Israel. He provided for them; he displayed His power to them; and willingly dwelt among them. And yet they still had no faith in Him.</p><p>I might be overlooking it, but I can’t seem to find much thankfulness from Israel during these times. Ungratefulness is a disease that spreads. Ingratitude is far worse than revenge, which is returning evil for evil, while ingratitude returns evil for good. Ungrateful people rarely forgive. Ungrateful people rarely do good unto others.</p><p>Ungratefulness begins with forgetfulness. If you forget that God brought you out of bondage, you won’t believe that He can bring you into your Promised Land. If you forget that He provided water in the desert, you won’t believe He can give you milk and honey. If you forget that He miraculously rained down manna, you’ll think you’re deprived of meat. If you forget that you didn’t get what you deserve, then you’ll think you’re entitled to anything.</p><p>Beloved, in every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you (1 Thess. 5:18). Thankfulness is the antidote to the disease of ungratefulness.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 11-13	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-11-13.png
561	2020-02-15 18:57:00	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>The wilderness wasn’t Israel’s destination. Their stay in the wilderness served as an interval between their redemption from Egypt and the possession of the Promised Land. Israel was a pilgrim nation in the wilderness, on their way to their promised destination. For this purpose the Tabernacle and their encampment were not stationary.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In Numbers 9-10 we see how God guided Israel from place to place. God used the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as a means for direction. The pillar of cloud hovered over the Tabernacle during the day (Num. 9:15). The pillar of fire hovered over the Tabernacle during the evening, providing light (Num. 9:16). And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped (Num. 9:17). Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out (Num. 9:22). To know whether to stay or move, it was imperative that the people kept a close watch on the pillar.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, Moses was to make two silver trumpets. The trumpets were to be blown to quickly give Israel orders. The sound of the trumpets gave distinct sounds, and each sound had specific instructions. So not only did Israel need to keep their eyes open to know if the pillar of cloud moved, they also needed to keep their ears attuned to the possible sound of the trumpets.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, beloved do you see the significance? No longer do we have a pillar of cloud or fire to guide us in the right direction. We now have the Word of God to give us directions (Ps. 119:105); the Holy Spirit to lead us (Rom. 8:26-27); and Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, to guide us in the darkness (Jn. 3:18-21; 8:12; 1 Jn. 1:4-10). Furthermore, Christians are pilgrims wandering this world, awaiting our promised destination. One of these days the Lord will the blow the trumpet, and we shall be gathered unto Him (1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-57).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 8-10	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-numbers-7-1.png
563	2020-02-14 02:47:32	\N	\N	\N	<p>The first four chapters of Numbers outline the layout of the camps, and the duties of the Levites. Instructions for life in the camp begins with chapter five. If the Lord was going to dwell with His people then it was important that Israel kept themselves from any defilement (Num. 5:3). Instructions included lepers being quarantined outside the camp; dishonest gain being confessed and offended parties being repaid; and suspected immorality being tested before God. Purity, honesty, and truth were the codes of the camp.</p><p>Chapter six includes a personal vow unto the Lord. If an Israelite wanted to separate themselves unto the LORD they would make a Nazirite vow (Num. 6:2). The Nazirite vow was a person who was separated unto God. Abstention from wine, strong drink, and unclean food were part of the commands. The Nazirite was also forbidden from touching anything that was dead. Furthermore, the Nazirite was not to cut his hair.</p><p>The holiness standards of chapter five were obligatory for all of Israel. The Nazirite vow was voluntary for individuals. There are corporate standards of holiness, and there are personal standards of holiness. Scripture gives instructions of holiness that every believer is to abide by. On the other hand, there are personal convictions that some may feel to live by. Both are done unto the Lord.</p><p>How close do you want to get to the Lord? That is the question. Holiness is not a killjoy. Holiness draws us in to closer proximity to Jesus Christ, and produces great joy! Holiness is not about loss, it is about gain. The apostle Paul said, “I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death (Php. 3:8-10).</p><p>Beloved, we don’t lose anything when we forsake something to draw closer to Jesus.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Numbers 5-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-5-6.png

566	2020-02-11 23:24:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>Numbers, if you’re like me, sounds like a book about, well, numbers. That doesn’t seem to be very inviting, does it? The Hebrew name for the fourth book of the Bible is in fact “Be-mider” meaning “in the wilderness” which comes from the first sentence of the book (Num. 1:1). The Alexandrian Jews in the third century (B.C.), who translated the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, entitled this fourth book “Arithmetic” which was translated into English as “Numbers.” I’m not sure which one is worse, “Arithmetic” or “Numbers.” It’s possible that many Bible readers avoid this book because its title, and the first several chapters are a census of Israel.</p><p>In actuality, the book of Numbers is an adventure. It picks up where Exodus left off. Israel is still in the wilderness on their way to Canaan, the promised land. The census at the beginning of the book is a numbering of the old generation, who fail to trust in God’s promises, and eventually die in the wilderness. Numbers records Israel’s forty years wandering the wilderness due to their unbelief.</p><p>While that may sound depressing, God entrusted His promises to the next generation of Israelites who ultimately believed God and took possession of the promised land.</p><p>The book of Numbers is more than about numbers. It’s about God’s covenant with His people, despite their unbelief. I think all of us can relate to that in one way or another. God remains faithful even though we have fits of doubt and unbelief. If you need a boost in your faith, then I encourage you to wander with Israel in the wilderness, and behold God’s faithfulness.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Number 1-2	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Numbers-1-2.png
567	2020-02-11 01:54:32	\N	\N	\N	<p>Leviticus concludes with God presenting Israel with a choice. The choice was either delight or despise God’s Law. If Israel would obey God’s Law then He would bless them. If, on the other hand, Israel disobeyed God’s Law then He would curse them. There were big implications with that little word “<em>if</em>.”</p><p>If Israel obeyed God’s Law then they would be blessed. Israel’s obedience would produce plenty of harvest (26:3-5). <em>Peace</em> and <em>protection</em> from surrounding nations depended upon their compliance to the Law (26:6-7) <em>Power</em> in unity rested on Israel’s observance of the Law (26:8). The nation would be <em>prosperous</em>, and in need of nothing if they just kept the Law (26:9-10). More importantly, they would have the distinct <em>privilege</em> of having God dwell in their midst by adhering to God’s Law (26:11-13). Faithfulness to God and His Law would make Israel a blessed people.</p><p>Nevertheless, Israel would be cursed if they disobeyed God and His Word. Defiance produced <em>disease</em> (26:16). Disregard generated <em>defeat</em> (26:17). Insubordination brought about <em>discipline</em> (26:18-20). Rebellion assured <em>distress</em> (26:21-26). Disdain generated <em>desolation</em> (26:27-36). Apostasy caused <em>defenselessness</em> (26:37-39). Faithlessness to God and His Law would make Israel a cursed people.</p><p>The Lord invoked another small word with large ramifications &#8211; “<em>but.</em>” Blessings flowed from obedience. Cursing proceeded from disobedience. But if Israel humbled themselves, and confessed their sins, then God would remember His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Repentance resulted in restoration (26:40-45).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, like Israel, we all have disobeyed God’s Law. The apostle Paul wrote, &#8220;For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them” (Gal. 3:10). We were under the curse of the Law, but Jesus Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us (Gal. 3:13). We were faithless, but He remained faithful (2 Tim. 2:13). Furthermore, if we have sinned, we too can humble ourselves in repentance, and He will be faithful to forgive us of all of our sins (1 Jn. 1:9).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 26-27	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-26-27.png

It had three branches on each side of a center shaft. The lamp was fueled by beaten olive oil. It was the priest’s duty to keep the lamp lit morning and evening. The Golden Lampstand is representative of the Word of God. Scripture is a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our path (Ps. 119:105). As the Word of God made flesh, Jesus is the Light of the world (Jn. 1:14; 8:12).</p><p>The Shewbread, also known as the Bread of Presence, was placed on golden table in the Holy Place. Twelve loaves were in two stacks of six, each representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The bread was to be replaced each sabbath, and eaten by the priests. Jesus said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Mt. 4:4). Believers find spiritual sustenance from Word of God.</p><p>Only the priesthood could occupy the Holy Place in the Tabernacle. But the children of Israel were represented though they were unable to physically be there. Upon Aaron’s breastplate were twelve stones representing the twelve tribes (Ex. 28:12). The bread that Aaron ate had been provided by the people. And the light from the Lampstand had been fueled by the people as well.</p><p>Dear reader, Jesus Christ is present with us through the Word of God illuminating our hearts, and giving us spiritual nourishment. Furthermore, believers are represented in the Holy Place as Christ is always making intercession for us (Heb. 7:25).</p></div>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 24-25	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-24-25.png

The key verse of Leviticus is “ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy” (Lev. 11:45). Leviticus is about holiness. A holy God. A holy people. Holy food. A holy sanctuary with holy furnishings. A holy priesthood with holy garments. Holy sacrifices. Holy worship. Holy festivals. Holy days. And a holy land. The whole book cries out, “holy, holy, holy!”</p><p>Holiness was distinguished by that which was clean or unclean. The Lord, through the Law, draws the line between that which is clean and unclean. Clean and unclean animals. Clean and unclean insects. Clean and unclean people. Clean and unclean places. You couldn’t touch a dead body or a dead animal, or you would be unclean. Certain bodily discharges made someone unclean, and the clothes and furniture that were touched by that person were considered unclean. If the priest was going to enter the sanctuary, he better stop by the brazen laver and get clean. Because nothing was to be unclean in the sanctuary, or in the sacred space where God was supposed to dwell.</p><p>Sacrifice had to be made if something was to be holy. Cleansing had to take place if something was to be considered clean.</p><p>The Bible teaches that sin entered the world through the disobedience of Adam, and thereby death by sin (Rom. 5:12). The fall of humanity produced the fall of the world. Death, disease, and defilements are the curse of sin. Leviticus brings into focus the damage done by sin, and nothing brings this idea into focus more than the teaching of leprosy.</p><h1>The Plague</h1><p>Leprosy wasn’t in itself sin. Rather, leprosy, and all other diseases, were the result of sin. Leprosy represented the uncleanliness of sin (Ps. 147:3; Isa. 1:5-6; Jer. 8:2; 30:12; Mk. 2:17). Leprosy was the scourge of the Ancient East. If anyone was diagnosed with leprosy it was like a death certificate.</p><p>Leprosy began imperceptibly. First there would be certain red spots which appeared in the skin. The spots were painless to begin with, but the pain would gradually increase. Still it was unbeknownst to the person whether they had leprosy. What began as a red spot increased in size and then began to spread all over the body. The spongy tumor-like swellings would grow on the face and body, and eventually effect the internal organs and cause the bones to deteriorate. The pain in the skin would subside as the plague infected the nerves, and one would not know whether something was scalding hot or freezing cold. If untreated, such as in ancient times, leprosy produced a weakness in the immune system, which made the victim vulnerable to other diseases. Leprosy was nearly incurable, and made its victims outcasts of society.</p><p>I do not have the vocabulary to describe all the loathsomeness and ghastliness of the aggravated cases of leprosy; it would be too sickening, if not disgusting. As fearful as leprosy seems to be, is a very poor portrait of the repulsiveness of sin.</p><p>God used the barbaric disease of leprosy to illustrate the offensiveness of leprosy. As such, leprosy and sin had much in common:</p><ul><li>Both are hereditary and contagious: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned” (Rom. 5:12).</li><li>Both work inwardly and manifest themselves outwardly.</li><li>Both, at first, don’t cause pain.</li><li>Both spread. Leprosy infected the person, the clothes, and then the house.</li><li>Both have the ability to seemingly disappear, but will come back.</li><li>Both maim, cripple, and destroy.</li><li>Both are hideous and loathsome.</li><li>Both isolate from society. Sin separates us from God. Additionally, If someone has sin, it’s not long before they stop coming to church, and associating with God’s people.</li><li>Both are humanly incurable.</li><li>Both produce death (Jas. 1:15)</li></ul><p>Leprosy’s outward symptoms indicated that this was more than just skin deep. Human behaviors indicate that sin isn’t just skin deep. In ancient times leprosy was highly contagious. Today, however, 90% of people are immune to the disease. Unlike leprosy, everyone has been infected with sin: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23). The prophet Jeremiah diagnosed man’s disease, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked” (Jer. 17:9).</p><p>Everything that a leper touched was considered defiled. If he drank from a cup it was unclean. If he sat on a chair, it was unclean. If he opened a door, it was unclean. He was corrupted, and everything that he touched was corrupted. Leviticus 13 and 14 shows that leprosy begins on the inside, works its way outwardly, and then the clothes and the home are corrupted. Isn’t this a picture of sin and the sinner? Paul said it best:</p><blockquote><p>“Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me” (Rom. 7:17-20).</p></blockquote><p>Leprosy caused the person to be isolated, away from God’s people.</p><h1>The Priest</h1><p>If a person had a scab, a swelling, scar, spot, scales, or sore, then that person needed to get to Aaron the High Priest, or one of his sons. The phrase “the priest shall look” is used no less than eighteen times in these two chapters. The leper wasn’t taken to the doctor, but he was taken to the priest.</p><p>Not everything that looked like leprosy actually was leprosy. It took a thorough examination from the priest to decide whether or not something was leprous. The investigation wasn’t exclusive to just the skin (13:1-46), but it also included the clothes (13:47-59), and the home (14:33-57).</p><blockquote><p>“When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests” (Leviticus 13:2).</p></blockquote><p>Note that it was Aaron, or one of his sons. First, Aaron foreshadowed Jesus Christ as our High Priest (Heb. 4:14; 5:9). Aaron’s sons prefigured New Testament believers as priests and sons of Christ (Rom. 8:17; Heb. 2:11; 1 Pt. 2:9).</p><p>It took the priesthood to diagnose the spots. Likewise, it takes Christ and His ministers to diagnose sin. The diagnosis of leprosy required a person to tear their clothes, put a covering over their lip, cry “unclean, unclean” whenever someone approached them, and they were to remain outside the camp until they either died or were healed.</p><p>If you go to the doctor and you don’t like a diagnosis, you want to get a second opinion. If you are misdiagnosed, or if a doctor is not honest with you, there’s a chance for malpractice. Correspondingly, there are some preachers who are afraid to diagnose sin. They would rather risk an infectious spread of sin within a congregation, than to isolate someone or some sin. Furthermore, there are too many saints who refuse a diagnosis of sin and find some false teacher who will soothe their conscience. Just as there is a difference between cancer and the common cold; there’s a difference between clean and unclean; holy and unholy; righteous and unrighteous.</p><h1>The Prescription</h1><p>Leviticus 13 is quite bleak. Chapter 14, on the other hand, offers a ray of hope. A person with leprosy can be cleansed and restored. We need the bad news of sin and judgment, before we can understand the good news of salvation.</p><p>There was an elaborate prescription to reinstate a person infected with leprosy. First, they had to be diagnosed by the priest. But this was different than all the other times. In the initial diagnosis the infected person came to the door of the tabernacle and had the priest come out to examine them. This there is a slight difference:</p><p>This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper (Leviticus 14:2–3).</p><p>The priest goes to the sufferer. Since the unclean person wasn’t allowed to enter the camp, the priest had to go outside the camp to minister the afflicted. Here we see Jesus Christ as our High Priest coming to where we are. Jesus said, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which is lost (Lk. 19:10). Jesus compared Himself to that of a physician coming to heal the sin-sick soul: “Those who are well have no need of a physical, but those who are sick” (Mt. 10:12). In the case of a leper, the priest was unable to heal, he was only able to examine and declare cleansing. Jesus, on the other hand, is the High Priest who comes to us and HEALS!</p><p>In order for the afflicted person to be considered cleansed and allowed into the camp, there had to be sacrifice. The significance of this is that four of the five offerings that the Lord outlined in the Law had to be accomplished: The Sin Offering, Trespass Offering, the Burnt Offering, and the Grain Offering.</p><p><strong>The Sin Offering (Lev. 4:1-5:13).</strong> The Sin Offering was offered for forgiveness of sin, or to be cleansed from physical impurity. Whatever animal was brought, the offerer had to identify with the sacrifice by laying hands on it.</p><p><strong>The Trespass Offering (Lev. 5:14-6:7; 7:1-10).</strong> The Sin Offering and Trespass Offering were quite similar. The Sin Offering was for sinning against God, the Trespass Offering was for sinning against God and man. Therefore, the offerer had to restore any property to the offended party, add a twenty percent fine with it, then offer a ram to the Lord.</p><p><strong>The Burnt Offering (Lev. 1;6:8-13).</strong> This was a voluntary act of worship, and was one of the most frequently made sacrifices. It expressed devotion to the Lord. For us at New Testament believers we can think of Paul’s words, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service” (Rom. 12:1).</p><p><strong>The Grain Offering (Lev. 2; 6:14-22).</strong> The worshiper brought a sacrifice of fine flour mingled with oil. No leaven or honey could be offered with this sacrifice. This offering speaks of Christ’s sinless humanity.</p><p>The unique things about this ceremony is that the priest treated the person cleansed from leprosy like a fellow priest! If you go back to Leviticus chapter eight you will see that it was only the priests, and lepers had this special ceremony.</p><p>The priest applied the blood of the trespass offering on the man’s right ear, right thumb, and right big toe. Next, he sprinkled oil on the man seven times and then put the oil on the blood that was already on his ear, thumb, and toe. Finally, he poured the oil on the man’s head. This is comparable to the ceremony Moses employed when he ordained Aaron and his sons It is amazing grace, that God should treat a former leper like a priest!</p><p>The leper was sprinkled with the blood of an innocent animal. He was then to wash his whole body. Finally, the priest would pour oil on the head of the cleansed man. Do you see the picture?!</p><p>Sinners are forgiven based upon the shed blood of Jesus Christ, who offers repentance from sins (Heb. 9:22). We are washed in the waters of baptism (Acts 2:38). Finally, the oil of the Holy Ghost is poured upon us (Acts 2:1-4).</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Beloved, the consequences of leprosy were only temporary, but the consequences of sin are everlasting. The Israelites knew no cure for leprosy, but there is a remedy for sin—faith in Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Have you trusted Him? Have you had you sins washed away? Have you been cleansed in the waters of baptism? Have you had the oil of the Holy Spirit poured out and into your heart?</p>	100	\N	The Plague, the Priest, and the Prescription	\N	/rsz_british-library-ayj9dp8lzks-unsplash.jpg
570	2020-02-08 18:21:14	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Feasts of Israel commemorated what the Lord had done for them in their history, and anticipated what He was going to do for them in the future. New Testament believers may feel these feasts are irrelevant to Christian life. However, these feasts are teeming with spiritual truths that are relevant for the modern Christian.</p><p><strong>The Passover.</strong> The Passover commemorated God’s deliverance of Israel out of Egypt. This feast comes first because its representative of that which comes first in redemption &#8211; the Lamb slain for sinners.</p><p><strong>The Feast of Pentecost (Feast of Weeks).</strong> Pentecost is celebrated fifty days after the Passover. The word “<em>pente</em>” in the Greek means <em>fifty</em>. This feast observes the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, and the celebration of the firstfruits of harvest. The Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, fifty days after Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead. The apostle Paul said that we have been given the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:23).</p><p><strong>The Feast of Trumpets.</strong> This feast took place on Israel’s New Year’s day. The sound of the trumpets was a call for Israel to regather to celebrate the two following feasts, The Day of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles. One of these days, the trump will sound, and the Church will be gathered together to Him (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thess. 4:16; 2 Thess. 2:1).</p><p><strong>The Day of Atonement.</strong> The Day of Atonement was one of the most important feasts for Israel. This was the one day of the year the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle or Temple and sprinkled the blood on the mercy seat. This was for the atonement of sins. For the Christian, Jesus Christ offered His own blood for the forgiveness of sins.</p><p><strong>The Feast of Tabernacles</strong>. This fruit harvest festival was the most joyous celebration of the year. It reminded Israel of God’s blessings in the wilderness, and looked forward to the blessings in the Promised Land. As Christians, we are blessed while here in the world. But there is a day coming when we will be with the Lord and enjoy Him forever.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 22-23	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-22-23.png
571	2020-02-07 17:57:00	\N	\N	\N	<p>Holiness isn’t limited to our relationship with God. Holiness includes our relationship with others. Believing that holiness is only about loving God, and not about loving our neighbors is faulty thinking. Too little is said about God’s people loving each other. Often the love of God gets all of the attention and little emphasis is given on how we should treat each other.</p><div class="text_exposed_show"><p>Leviticus 19 gives certain laws concerning how Israel was to treat each other, the poor, servants, and strangers. The poor wasn’t to be taken advantage of (Lev. 19:9-10). Stealing and cheating each other was prohibited (Lev. 19:11-14; 35-36). Injustice, lying and gossip was not allowed (Lev. 19:15-16). Hating someone and taking vengeance was off-limits (Lev. 19:17-18). Strangers were to be loved and cared for within the land of Israel (Lev. 19:33-34). If Israel was going to be a holy nation, it was going to be displayed in how they loved and treated each other. These principles could be summed like this: “you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord” (Lev. 19:16b).</p><p>Jesus quoted this very verse in the New Testament, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Mk. 12:31). Jesus also said, “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” (Jn. 13:34-35).</p><p>Holiness goes beyond our love for God. Holiness also affects our love for one another. The apostle John wrote, “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love” (1 Jn. 4:7-8).</p><p>Taking care of the poor in your community is holiness. Treating your employees with dignity is holiness. Telling the truth and avoiding gossip is holiness. Being kind to your waitress in the restaurant is holiness. Paying your bills on time is holiness. Loving those who despitefully use you is holiness.</p><p>Beloved, let holiness be exemplified in our love for God, and in our love for one another.</p></div>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 19-21	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-19-21.png
572	2020-02-06 22:44:43	\N	\N	\N	<p>I witnessed to a man several years ago, and after several meetings he said, “I’d like to come to church, but there’s just so much talk about blood.” My attempts to explain Scripture’s emphasis on blood seemed to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Leviticus 17:11 says, “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” When an animal was given as a sacrifice and its blood was shed, it was an atonement for one’s sins. The animal’s innocent life was being given for the sake of a sinful life. The word “atonement” in the Hebrew means “to ransom,” or “to remove by paying a price.” Because the blood is the life of the animal, and the ordained means for atonement, it couldn’t be eaten.</p><p>The shed blood of an animal was to only be offered at one place &#8211; the altar: “and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls.” The life of the animal was in the blood, but it had to be shed at the altar for the ransom of the soul.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, is this not another wonderful example of Jesus Christ? Unlike the sacrificial animal that gave its life unwillingly, Christ voluntarily gave His life for sinner (Jn 10:18). Unlike the priest of the Tabernacle that offered an animal on the altar, Christ gave His own life as a ransom at Calvary (Mk. 10:45). Unlike the priest that offered the sacrifices perpetually, Christ shed His precious blood once and for all (Heb. 9:27-10:10)!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-16-18.png
573	2020-02-05 18:34:22	\N	\N	\N	<p>Leviticus 13 and 14 describe the awful disease of leprosy and the remedy if one were to contract this affliction. Leprosy wasn’t just an issue in the Old Testament, it was also the scourge of Israel in the days of Jesus. Leprosy was and is still the foulest of diseases.</p><p>Today leprosy is known as Hansen’s disease, named after the man who discovered the causative agent of leprosy in 1873. Leprosy would cause spongy tumor-like swellings to grow on the face and body, and eventually effect the internal organs and cause the bones to deteriorate. If untreated, such as in ancient times, leprosy produced a weakness in the immune system, which made the victim vulnerable to other diseases. Leprosy was nearly incurable, and made its victims outcasts of society.</p><p>There’s more to leprosy than just an affliction of the body. Elsewhere in Scripture disease is representative of sin (Ps. 147:3; Isa. 1:5-6; Jer. 8:2; 30:12; Mk. 2:17). Leprosy’s outward symptoms indicated that this was more than just skin deep. Human behaviors indicate that sin isn’t just skin deep. In ancient times leprosy was highly contagious. Today, however, 90% of people are immune to the disease. Unlike leprosy, everyone has been infected with sin: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23).

Dear reader, Jesus Christ was the Priest that came to us, diagnosed our sinful condition, and became the sacrifice for all, declaring us clean!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 13-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-13-15.png
574	2020-02-04 19:15:38	\N	\N	\N	<p>We’ve come to another example of separation in the Bible. Think back to what we’ve already covered in our daily readings. In creation, God separated the light from the darkness; the day from the night; the waters from the heavens; the land from the sea; and humans from animals. Next, God called Abraham and had him separate from his family and hometown. In Exodus God delivered Israel from Egypt to make them a distinct people for God’s purpose. The principle of separation continued in Israel’s worship with the Tabernacle and its furnishings, and the consecration (another word for separation) of the priesthood for service.</p><p>Israel&#8217;s relationship with God included <em>sacrifice</em>, <em>separation</em>, and <em>service</em>. The way to God is outlined in the <em>sacrifices</em> found Leviticus chapters 1-10. Their walk with God is outlined in the <em>separation</em> found in Leviticus chapters 11-20. And the worship of God is outlined in the <em>services</em> found in Leviticus chapters 21-27. Likewise, as New Testament believers, our relationship with God included sacrifice, separation, and service.</p><p>Israel’s walk with God demanded their separation from unclean things. Whether an animal was clean or unclean had nothing to do with the quality of the animal. A beast was clean or unclean if God declared it so. Israel couldn’t “agree to disagree” with God. In like manner, we have to see things the way God sees things, especially concerning sin. If God considers something to be sin, then we are not given the allowance to reclassify it.</p><p>To walk with God means to walk in agreement with Him (Amos 3:3). If God calls something unclean, then we have to agree with Him. Presently the majority walk contrary to what God says. Sin is being reclassified, or given more acceptable titles. The Lord said through the prophet Isaiah, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter” (Isa. 5:20).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it is up to God to decide what is clean or unclean. If God considers something detestable or an abomination, then it is not up for debate. Walking with Jesus demands that we see things as He sees them. The old saying goes, “You can’t walk with Jesus and wink at the devil.”</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 11-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-11-12.png
575	2020-02-03 19:47:23	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Leviticus chapter 10 is shocking to say the least. At first glance it seems as if God is unjust by killing Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron. If we are not careful, our emotions will get the best of us and we will miss an important lesson on intent.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nadab and Abihu each took his censor put fire on it, added incense upon it, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded (Lev. 10:1). So fire went out from the Lord and killed them (Lev. 10:2). Did the Lord kill Aaron’s two sons because they were ignorant? Or is there something deeper at work?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nadab and Abihu’s actions were wrong. First, they were the wrong people to be handling incense, Aaron was supposed to do that (Ex. 30:7-10). They used the incorrect instruments too, for it was supposed to Aaron’s incense burner which had to be consecrated (Ex. 40:9). Next, it wasn’t the right time to be offering incense, for that was to be done on the annual Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:1). Furthermore, the Lord had not commanded they offer incense (Lev. 10:1). Then Aaron’s two sons used the wrong kind of fire, perhaps using coals from someplace other than the Brazen Altar. It is possible that Nadab and Abihu may have been under the influence of alcohol, since the Lord commanded Aaron, “Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die” (Lev. 10:8-9). Nadab and Abihu weren’t acting out of naivety. Their intent wasn’t one of ignorance, it was blatant disobedience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the chapter, after Aaron’s sons were killed, we read of Aaron, Mishael, and Elzaphan (Aaron’s cousins) not eating the sacrifice from the sin offering. Moses found the carcass of the goat burning on altar. Moses was outraged, considering that Aaron’s sons had just been killed for disobedience. But the men were cautious about following the instructions of Moses to the letter. They were supposed to eat some of the sin offering and burn the rest. They chose, however, to willingly give up some of their privileges out of respect to Aaron and the Lord. Nadab and Abihu had overstepped their boundaries. Aaron, Mishael, and Elzaphan decided to forgo their privileges out of reverence to the Lord (Lev. 10:16-20).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, intent is a matter of the heart. The writer of Hebrews says, “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Heb. 4:12). Is your intent to gratify the lusts of the flesh? Or is your intent to glorify the holiness of God</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 8-10	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-leviticus-5-7-1.png
576	2020-02-03 18:13:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>Interpreter’s house turned out to be an interesting place. Christian toured seven rooms of the house, each depicting spiritual truth. I want to take a closer look at the dusty room, and the room which contained the man in the iron cage.</p><h1>The Dusty Room</h1><p>The second room of Interpreter’s house was full of dust. I remember having to clean my room when I was a kid. I wasn’t the best at it. I shoved junk under my bed, or piled everything up on a chair to give the perception of a “cleaned” room. The more I put off cleaning my room, the dirtier it became. That’s what happened in this room at Interpreter’s house. The prolonging of cleaning allowed dust to accumulate.</p><p>Interpreter called for a man to sweep the room. Now, when he began to sweep, the dust began to abundantly fly about the room. Christian nearly choked! Interpreter then called for a damsel to bring some water and sprinkle the room; the which, when she had done, it was swept and cleansed with pleasure.</p><p>Interpreter explained that the room was the heart of man, that had never been sanctified by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Like the dusty room, man’s heart had been defiled by sin. Now, the man who initially swept the room was the Law. The Law was unable to cleanse man of sin, rather, it only revealed man’s sinfulness (Rom. 7:7-13). The dust only multiplied as the man swept. Likewise, the Law came in to increase the trespass of sin (Rom. 5:20).</p><p>The damsel who sprinkled water in the room was the gospel. Though the Law reveals the nature and power of sin, a heart can only be cleansed through the gospel. The apostle Paul said that we are washed and cleansed by the washing of water with the Word of God, the Holy Spirit, by the Name of Jesus Christ (Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5-6; 1 Cor. 6:11; cf. Heb. 10:22). The dust of sin in the heart can only be cleansed through gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><h1>The Man in the Iron Cage</h1><p>The room which contained the man in the iron cage was the most tragic room of all. The man in the iron cage was a pitiful sight to behold. The man seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes looking down to the ground, his hands folded together, and he sighed as if his heart would break.</p><p>Christian asked the man for the reasoning behind his plight. He replied, “I am not what I once was.” Christian inquired further, “What were you previously?” The man in the iron cage answered, “I was once a professing believer. I was once on my way to the Celestial City, and believed I would arrive there. I am now a man of despair, and am shut up in it, as in this iron cage. I cannot get out!” The man continued, “I became careless, and ceased to be vigilant in my pursuit of righteousness. I gave into my lusts and desires, and sinned against the light of the Word. I have grieved the Holy Spirit, and He is gone. I have hardened my heart, that I cannot repent.”</p><p>Christian couldn’t believe his ears. Here was a man who had been on the same journey as Christian, but was now living in an iron cage. Inside the iron cage the man lamented, “I have crucified the Lord afresh; I have despised His person; I have despised His righteousness; I have counted His blood an unholy thing; I have done despite to the Spirit of grace.” The man in the iron cage had committed apostasy, he had turned away from the faith once delivered to the saints, and gave into his lusts.</p><p>Interpreter finally added, “Let this man’s misery be remembered by you, and be an everlasting caution to you.” Believers, and anyone else on the Christian journey, could end up in the same condition as the man in the iron cage. Bunyan is writing to every Christian to persevere in the faith. The Christian journey is not without its adversaries, for Peter wrote, “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Pt. 5:8).</p><h1>Application</h1><p>What can we take away from these two rooms in Interpreter’s house?</p><p>First, we need the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 Jn. 1:9). The same gospel message that initially saves us is the same message that works for our sanctification.</p><p>Second, the man in the iron cage should serve as a warning to us, just as he did to Christian. The dusty room serves as a figure of sin in our hearts, and the man in the iron depicts the consequences of not continuing to put to death the sins of the body after salvation (Rom. 8:13). Working out our own salvation with fear and trembling is just as important as initial salvation (Php. 2:12). You and I can never become negligent in our pursuit of holiness. Sin is always crouching at the door of our heart, ready to overtake us.</p>	100	\N	Interpreter&#8217;s House: The Dusty Room and the Man in the Iron Cage	\N	/denny-muller-aQ-UflroU5A-unsplash-scaled.jpg
577	2020-02-02 22:31:56	\N	\N	\N	<p>The first seven chapters of Leviticus outline the five major offerings required under the Law. The five offerings can be divided into two main types: Sweet Savor offerings and Non-Sweet Savor offerings. The Sweet Savor offerings were voluntary, and the Non-Sweet Savor offerings were mandatory.</p><h2>Sweet Savor Offerings</h2><p><strong>The Burnt Offering</strong> (Lev. 1;6:8-13). This was a voluntary act of worship, and was one of the most frequently made sacrifices. It expressed devotion to the Lord. For us at New Testament believers we can think of Paul’s words, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service” (Rom. 12:1).</p><p><strong>The Grain Offering</strong> (Lev. 2; 6:14-22). The worshiper brought a sacrifice of fine flour mingled with oil. No leaven or honey could be offered with this sacrifice. This offering speaks of Christ’s sinless humanity.</p><p><strong>The Peace Offering</strong> (Lev. 3; 7:11-34). This sacrifice was a shared meal between the offerer and the priesthood. This fellowship meal was made possible by a spotless lamb. Beloved, we have peace with God and fellowship with one another through the blood of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:11-22).</p><h2>Non-Sweet Savor Offerings</h2><p><strong>The Sin Offering</strong> (Lev. 4:1-5:13). The Sin Offering was offered for forgiveness of sin, or to be cleansed from physical impurity. Whatever animal was brought, the offerer had to identify with the sacrifice by laying hands on it.</p><p><strong>The Trespass Offering</strong> (Lev. 5:14-6:7; 7:1-10). The Sin Offering and Trespass Offering were quite similar. The Sin Offering was for sinning against God, the Trespass Offering was for sinning against God and man. Therefore, the offerer had to restore any property to the offended party, add a twenty percent fine with it, then offer a ram to the Lord.</p><p>Much could be written about these five offerings. We should glean from our reading the high cost of sin. Knowing the high cost of sin should birth within us praise! For Jesus Christ is our offering, for He bore our sins on His body and paid the full price for us (1 Pt. 1:18-19; 2:24).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 5-7	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-5-7.png
578	2020-02-01 21:48:48	\N	\N	\N	<p>You’ve made it to Leviticus. You may feel like giving up in the coming days. That’s due to the fact that Leviticus is made up of 27 head-scratching chapters that may not seem important to the rest of the Bible, or to your present day life. I want to encourage you to read through Leviticus and see it’s significance in the Bible and in your life.</p><p>The last section of Exodus concerned the Tabernacle and the Levitical Priesthood (Ex. 25-40). Keep in mind that the priesthood came from the tribe of Levi (Num. 3-4). The word “Leviticus” comes from the Greek word “Leuitikos” which means “that which pertains to the Levites.” The reasoning for the Tabernacle and the Priesthood was for the sole purpose of God dwelling within Israel’s camp. Because God is holy, it is imperative that His dwelling, and His people are holy.</p><p>The word “holiness” and corresponding words are found over 130 times in the book. The Lord says, “ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy” (Lev. 11:45). We can conclude that Leviticus concerns God’s holiness and the holiness of His people. But how can a Holy God dwell among a sinful people like Israel. Likewise, how can a Holy God dwell among sinners like us? Leviticus gives us the answers:</p><p>Leviticus begins by clarifying sacrifices that address sin, and enables Israel to worship God correctly (Lev. 1-7). The Law provides Israel with priests who will intercede on their behalf (Lev. 8-10). Next, Leviticus teaches Israel how to appropriately deal with impurity (Lev. 11-15), and follows that up with how to remove impurity in the yearly ceremony of the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16). Finally, the last section of Leviticus provides various laws for Israel to live as a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Lev. 17-27; cf. Ex. 19:5-6).</p><p>Leviticus points us to Jesus Christ. Jesus is our High Priest interceding on our behalf (Heb. 4:14, 7:25); He shed His blood to forgive our sins (Heb. 9:12, 22); He provided the means for us to worship Him in Spirit and Truth (Jn. 4:21-23); and because He is holy, He enables us to be holy (1 Pt. 1:15-16).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Leviticus 1-4	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Leviticus-1-4.png
579	2020-02-01 00:49:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Tabernacle included seven items: the Brazen Altar; the Brazen Laver; the Table of Shewbread; the Candle-Stand; the Altar of Incense; The Ark of the Covenant; and the Mercy Seat.</p><p>The High Priest wore seven articles to minister within the Tabernacle: undergarments (Ex. 28:42-43); a white tunic (Ex. 28:39; 39:27); a blue robe over that, with bells and pomegranates on the hem (Ex. 28:31-35; 39:22-26); a sleeveless ephod embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet thread, held together by a clasp on the shoulder (Ex. 28:6-8; 39:2-7); a decorative girdle for the ephod (Ex. 28:8); the breastplate (Ex. 28:9-30; 39:8-21); and a turban with a golden plate attached to it with the inscription “Holiness to the Lord” (Ex. 28:36; 39:30-31).</p><p>Throughout Scripture the number seven refers to completion. Here’s what happened when Israel finished and erected the Tabernacle: “Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle” (Ex. 40:34). God’s glory filled the house once Moses and Israel did all that the Lord told them to do. Complete obedience produces God’s Spirit filling the Tabernacle.</p><p>Furthermore, the Tabernacle typified New Testament salvation. The sacrificial death at the Brazen Altar points to repentance and dying out to sin (Rom. 6:2). Washing at the Brazen Laver represents baptism and the washing away of sins (Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; Eph. 5:26). God’s glory filling the Tabernacle signifies a believer being filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:4,38; Eph. 5:18).</p><p>Beloved, you are the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19), be like Moses, and accomplish everything according to the plan (Ex. 39:32;42; 40:16).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 39-40	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-39-40.png
580	2020-01-30 20:47:20	\N	\N	\N	<p>Moses was an exceptional leader. Moses, like most leaders, believed he could do everything. He could stand before the Lord on behalf of Israel. He could stand before Israel on behalf of the Lord. He could lead Israel throughout the wilderness. If need be, he could lead them into battle. And if that wasn’t enough, he could judge Israel. All two million of them!</p><p>A few chapters back we read of Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, coming to visit. Jethro was shocked to see Moses doing all of this work and warned him, “The thing that thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou are not able to perform it thyself alone” (Ex. 18:17-18). Jethro encouraged Moses to find capable men who could help divide some of Moses’ load. Thank God for elders who can give us wise counsel.</p><p>God didn’t expect for Moses to be all things to all people. Moses didn’t have to be the High Priest, Aaron could do that. Moses didn’t have to sit and judge all of Israel, he could entrust that responsibility to other holy men. Moses didn’t have to design or fabricate the Tabernacle and its furnishings, Bezaleel had the ability to do that.</p><p>Moses learned to trust other’s abilities: “And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it” (Ex. 36:2).</p><p>What can we learn from our reading today? First, Moses couldn’t do everything on his own, he needed help. No matter how talented or gifted you might be, you can always use help. Second, Bezaleel and his helpers were anointed to fabricate the assembling of the Tabernacle. These men may not have had the same title or position as Moses, but their work brought value to God’s kingdom. Every church, and ministry needs a Moses. But they also need Bezaleels who can actualize the vision of a leader.</p><p>Beloved, God has anointed all of us with spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 12:14-27). Let us use them for the glory of God!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 36-38	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-36-38.png
581	2020-01-29 17:49:29	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>Parents sacrifice convenience in order to please our children. Face it, no parent enjoys going to Chuck E. Cheese. For the sake of our children, however, we take them. We have thoughts like, “I’ll take you to Chuck E. Cheese, but I don’t have to like it.” Our kids enjoy it, while we half-heartedly smile choking down overpriced frozen pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After the golden calf debacle, the Lord promised to bring Israel into the Promised Land, keeping His covenant with the Patriarchs (Ex. 33:1-2). There was just one caveat, the Lord said, “I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way” (Ex. 33:3). Israel was going to possess the Promised Land, but the Lord was not going to be in their midst. He was going to send His Angel to lead them in His place. In other words, He was going, but He wasn’t happy about it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moses had the privilege of speaking with God face to face (Ex. 33:11). What an amazing thought to be able to speak face to face with God. Moses could have asked for anything while he communed with God, but this was his request: “And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth“ (Ex. 33:15-16).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A land flowing with milk and honey meant absolutely nothing if God wasn’t going with them. Moses’ request was for God’s presence to be with Israel. If Israel didn’t have the presence of the Lord, then they had nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beloved, it is imperative that God’s presence be with us. If He is not with us, then everything will be against us. All of the blessings, and promises mean nothing without Him. We used to sing an old song that said, “Take this whole world, but give me Jesus.” If you have the world, but don’t have Jesus, then you have nothing. But if you have Jesus, you have everything.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 33-35	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-exodus-30-32-1.png

582	2020-01-28 16:14:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>At the top of Mount Sinai, Moses received God’s provisions for worship. God revealed His holiness through the Law, Tabernacle, sacrifices, and priesthood. His expectation was for Israel to worship and serve with holiness.</p><p>At the top of the mountain God’s holiness was revealed, and at the foot of the mountain man’s sinfulness was revealed. Israel grew restless at the foot of Mount Sinai. Together with Aaron, Israel believed that Moses wasn’t coming back. Instead of waiting on Moses, they created a golden calf from their melted jewelry. Moses came down the mountain and found them worshiping and sacrificing to the idol they created. The first commandment of only worshiping the Lord had been broken (Ex. 20:3-5).</p><p>Author Timothy Keller said, “The Bible tells us that the human heart is an ‘idol-factory,’ taking good things and making them into idols that drive us.” Within our heart is the ability to create our own gods. You may not bow down to a golden calf in your living room, but anything you submit your life to is an idol. Whatever captivates your heart, and leads you away from Jesus Christ is an idol. Many good and harmless things can be fabricated into idols. Money, material possessions, entertainment, sports, careers, and relationships can be fabricated into golden calves that we bow down to.</p><p>The Lord needed someone to represent His holiness to Israel. Israel needed someone to represent their need for mercy before God. “And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou will forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written” (Ex. 32:31-32). Moses was the mediator between Israel’s sinful idolatry and God’s righteousness. Moses, as a ransom, stood before the Lord and pleaded for mercy on Israel’s behalf.</p><p>Dear reader, this is a picture of Jesus Christ! God needed a man who was holy enough to represent His righteousness on earth. Sinful humanity needed a mediator who could represent their plight to a Holy God. The apostle Paul wrote, “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time” (1 Tim. 2:5-6).</p><p>Jesus Christ gave His life as a ransom to save us from sin’s condemnation (Mt. 20:28).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 30-32	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-30-32.png
583	2020-01-27 20:31:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>Today’s reading in Exodus 28 and 29 shouldn’t be overlooked or skimmed. These two chapters reveal God’s attention to detail. Everything in the Tabernacle was teeming with significance. This is also true concerning the Priesthood and their consecration.</p><p>The service of the Tabernacle was no ordinary work. Therefore, the men who served in the Tabernacle were to be uniquely prepared. The Lord said to Moses, “Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests” (Ex. 29:1 ESV). The word “consecrate” means to be “holy” “removed from common use” or “set apart.” On a macro level, all of Israel was to be holy and set apart. Likewise, on a micro level, the Tabernacle, its vessels, and its priesthood were to be holy. Holiness was a way of life. The people were to be holy, if God was going to dwell among them.</p><p>Aaron and his son’s calling parallels that of the Christian’s. Like Aaron and his sons, we were “taken” from the world (Ex.28:1; 2 Cor. 6:14-18); “brought” before the Lord (Ex. 29:4; Jn. 6:44); “washed” of our defilements (Ex. 29:4; 1 Cor. 6:11); “clothed” with righteousness (Ex. 29:5-9; Isa. 61:10; Rev. 19:8); “anointed” by the Spirit (Ex. 29:21; 1 Jn. 2:27); and “sanctified” for service (Ex. 29:44; Heb. 10:10).</p><p>The priesthood’s calling and the believer’s salvation is only made possible through sacrifice. A young bull, and two rams had to die in order that the priesthood could be sanctified. Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ gave His life so we could be saved and sanctified. He died so we could be made whole and holy.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 28-29	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-28-29.png
584	2020-01-26 14:05:21	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>God delivered to Moses a blueprint concerning His dwelling among His people. Every detail of the Tabernacle was given attention and was baptized with significance. This transportable structure would be stationary at particular points in the wilderness. The Tabernacle would dwell at the centermost part of the camp with each tribe of Israel strategically situated around it. The presence of God was to be the center of the Israelite’s life.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The blueprint of the Tabernacle began with the interior and worked out to the exterior (Ex. 25-27). So it is with the Christian. Salvation begins in the inner man, in the heart, then sanctification works from the inside out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The order of the Tabernacle, as it would be approached, is as follows. The Brazen Altar was used for offering sacrifices. The Laver, filled with water, was the place where the priesthood washed ceremonially. Just inside the Holy Place, prayer was offered at the Altar of Incense. Fresh bread was to be eaten at the Table of Shewbread. The only light shining in that holy space illuminated from the Golden Lamp Stand. A veil separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, which housed the Ark of the Covenant. Above the Ark sat the Mercy Seat decorated with two cherubim. On the Day of Atonement blood was sprinkled upon the Ark. The Glory of God would descend and fill the Holy of Holies once the High Priest correctly fulfilled the process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Brothers and sisters, the Tabernacle in the Old Testament was only a type and shadow of heavenly realities (Heb. 8:5). It pointed to a better Tabernacle and a better dwelling. Jesus Christ was the Word of God tabernacled in flesh (Jn. 1:14). He was the Lamb of God offered as the sacrifice for sins (Jn. 1:29). He is the Bread of Life (Jn. 6:48) and the Living Water (Jn. 4:10-14). He is the Light shining in the darkness of sin (Jn. 9:5). He has a Name that can be used in prayer and supplication (Jn. 14:14). He was the Mercy Seat which brought grace upon grace (Jn. 1:16). What could be better than Christ being tabernacled among us? Jesus said He would come to dwell in us as the Holy Ghost (Jn. 14:16-17)!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Behold, the Tabernacle of God!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 25-27	\N	/daily-readings-in-the-bible-exodus-22-24-1.png
585	2020-01-25 23:16:52	\N	\N	\N	<p>Have you ever been invited somewhere of importance, or to meet someone of great stature? Meeting a celebrity or a person of power can be intimidating. If you are anything like me, you get nervous or anxious. I usually can’t speak clearly. I don’t know what it is, but being near someone of great distinction makes me feel a little more self-aware.</p><p>The Lord spoke to Moses from Mount Sinai, “Come up to me into the mount, and be there” (Ex. 24:1,12) Has there been a greater invitation extended than this? The Creator of heaven and earth invited Moses to come up into the mountain and speak face to face. Granted, God had spoken to Moses many times previously. This time was different. Moses seen the Lord! And what a sight he beheld! Moses spent the next forty days and nights in the presence of Almighty God.</p><p>Moses went up into the mountain, and God came down. Here in a cloud of glory, Moses received the commandments written on tables of stone. More importantly, Moses received the plans for the Tabernacle and the priesthood. God was preparing to come near His people. Preparations had to be made for God to dwell amongst His people.</p><p>For Moses and Israel the Law was written on tablets of stone, and sacrifices would be given in order to cleanse the people. The writer of Hebrews stated that these were just a shadow of things to come. Brothers and sisters, God came even nearer to us that believe. Moses prepared the Tabernacle for God to come into Israel’s camp. In Jesus Christ, God prepared a body, so that God could dwell among us (Jn. 1:14). The Law of God wouldn’t be written on tablets of stone, but written on our hearts and minds. Now God, was going to dwell in the hearts of His people through the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Jesus Christ opened the veil and has invited us to come into His presence. The writer of Hebrew concluded, “Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (Heb. 10:22). Leave your sins behind and draw near to Him. Leave your anxiety behind and draw near to Him. Leave your worries behind and draw near to Him. Leave your fear behind and draw near to Him. Leave your past behind and draw near to Him.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 22-24	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-22-24.png
634	2019-05-13 12:05:50	\N	\N	\N	<p>Mother’s Day is a time where we honor our mothers, and celebrate who they are, and what they have done for us. Like other holidays, perhaps we should honor and celebrate our mothers more than once a year, for mothers play a very important role in our lives.</p><p>Russell Moore, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, wrote recently:</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>Why do dying men call for ‘Mama?’ That’s the question I’ve been pondering for months, since reading a line in an Atlantic Monthly article about what we can learn from the last words of the dying. Surveying how many of the dying use similar words—often evoking childhood and family—in their final moments, the author quoted a hospice nurse from a German magazine, about how there was, in this nurse’s experience, a common factor among the dying men with whom she worked: ‘Almost everyone is calling for ‘Mommy’ or ‘Mama’ with the last breath</em>.”</p><p>From the moment you are conceived, to the last moments of your life, and everything in between, our mothers are very influential.</p><p>There are some very interesting stories about mothers throughout the Bible. We could probably name several prominent mothers in Scripture. Such as Eve, Sarah, Hannah, and Mary, the mother of Jesus.</p><p>But there are many other mothers in the Bible whose names are not given. Such is the case of Samson’s mother. She is simply known as the wife of Manoah, and the mother of Samson. Though she more than likely had a name, Scripture does not reveal it to us. She may have been nameless, but in her short story it is revealed that she was faithful. This evening I will attempt to look at this nameless, but faithful mother, and prove how she is an example to each of us. In spite of her remaining unnamed in Scripture, she was a woman of faithful endurance, and unwavering commitment. Whether you are a veteran mother, a newly christened mother, a mother in waiting, or perhaps you just need a little encouragement, then this nameless mother will be our guide.</p><h1>She Was a Disappointed Woman</h1><p>“<em>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son</em>” (Judges 13:2–3).</p><p>Manoah’s wife was in the company of other great women who also suffered with barrenness. Bible readers are familiar with Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah, and Elizabeth. How disappointing it must have felt to not be able to have children. Jewish culture placed a great emphasis on child-bearing.</p><p>Many have tasted the bitterness of disappointment. Manoah’s wife must have felt like she had been overlooked. It should be noted that God had not overlooked her barrenness for an angel of the Lord appeared to her and relayed a message that she was already familiar with.</p><p>You may feel as if you have been overlooked, and your trouble is forgotten, but your heavenly Father has already taken note.</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>Thou tellest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle: Are they not in thy book</em>? (Psalm 56:8).</p><p>Dear mother, every tear you have shed, and every prayer you have prayed has been recorded in God’s book. You are not overlooked, nor are you forgotten. It’s just a matter of time before your prayers are answered. It’s just a matter of time before God commissions your miracle. God can take some of the most desperate situations and use them to bring Himself glory. Sarah may have been weeping due to her barrenness, but God turned it into laughter with Isaac. Hannah may have been troubled over her lack of a son, but she prayed until God moved on her behalf. Elizabeth may have been empty in the twilight of her life, but God could fill her womb with a spirit-filled preacher in a moment.</p><p>You may not know why you’ve been through what you’ve gone through. You may not know why you’re going through what you’re currently going through, but we can trust in this promise:</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose”</em> (Romans 8:28).</p><h1>She Was A Dedicated Woman</h1><p><em>Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</em><br /><em>For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</em><br /><em>But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</em><br /><em>And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware</em> (Judges 13:4–5, 7, 13).</p><p>The peculiar message of the angel must have been shocking to Samson’s mother. She will have a son, and she is not to drink any wine or strong drink and not to eat any unclean thing. The demands of Manoah’s wife were imperative. The condition of having a son came with the price of keeping herself undefiled. Modern day mothers are taught not to drink alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, or to indulge in smoking due to the fact that it could harm and addict the baby to these substances. But this was not the entire point of the command. God’s command went beyond the child’s health and reached to his soul.</p><p>Samson’s consecration did not begin at his birth, rather it began at his conception. Samson’s example of holiness would come from his mother. And notice that it would begin before he would be born. Many times parents try too late to give their children an example of consecration and holiness. To give a child an example of what it looks like to serve God begins before they are born.</p><p>Manoah’s wife was like a myriad of other mothers who would sacrifice anything for the well-being of their children. How many mothers have laid their dreams upon an altar so their children could succeed? How many mothers have forgone their own comfort so their children could be comfortable? To Manoah’s wife this was a small sacrifice for her son. Like any other mother she would have given up far more if asked.</p><p>Samson’s mother was dedicated to her own holiness, and to her son’s holiness. Often times the parent is dedicated to seeing their children be holy, and overlook their own holiness. And I’ve even seen parents rather have their children be a reckless child of the devil, than see them be a follower of Christ. Samson’s mother was dedicated to serving the Lord, and dedicated to making sure that Samson also was dedicated.</p><p>Samson needed an example of what dedication looked like. It’s not enough just to tell a child what they are to do, or not to do, they need the example. “Do as I say, and not as I do” is not going to produce strong children. I’d dare say, Samson’s strength paled in comparison to the strength and dedication of his mother. How many can testify to the fact that you’re where you are today because of the dedication and perseverance of a spiritually strong mother?</p><p>The home is the birthplace of holiness. Church is not the only example a child is to experience holiness and godly commitment. It is the home that will guide and teach. I have seen time and time again what a church accomplishes in teaching spiritual principles to a child is often undone in the home. God gave the command first to Samson’s mother and then to Samson. How could Samson be holy if he didn’t know what holiness looked like? The culture was incapable of teaching Samson because Israel was doing what was acceptable in their own eyes. If we are to raise holy children we must be holy ourselves. If Samson was to be a Nazirite, then he needed the shining example of what of Nazirite looked like.</p><p>Like Joshua we must declare, “as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord” (Josh. 24:15).</p><h1>She Was a Devout Woman</h1><p><em>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground</em> (Judges 13:19–20).</p><p>The spiritual climate in Israel was cold. Israel’s indifference to the Lord led to their bondage. God allowed the children of Israel to be put into the hands of the Philistines for forty years (Judges 13:1). The book of Judges shows that when Israel backslid they would be put in bondage by an enemy, they would cry out to the Lord, He would raise up a deliverer, they would be freed, then the cycle would start all over again. The story of Samson ends this cycle, for Israel does not cry out for God to help them, and this time God ordains for a couple to birth Israel’s future deliverer. But what God needed was a devoted father and mother. Thankfully there was a couple that had not turned to either worshiping an idol or to doing evil.</p><p>The world may be growing darker, and the church may be growing colder, but the Lord always has a people who are devoted. Samson’s mother was such a woman. Not only was she dedicated, she was also devout. While Israel was bowing down to false idols, she was building an altar, and offering sacrifices to the Lord.</p><p>If Samson is going to be strong, his mother not only needs a to be dedicated to a particular lifestyle, she must also be a worshipper. There are too many who live a particular restricted lifestyle, but fail to build altars of prayer and worship.</p><p>American evangelist and author R.A. Torrey claimed his own conversion followed years of his mother&#8217;s prayers. He would say later, “Oh, men, in the desperate hardness of our hearts, we often trample our mother&#8217;s teaching under foot, but we find it very hard to get over her prayers.”</p><p>Samson had an example of dedication, and he also had an example of devotion. Hell has an awful time thwarting the prayers of a mother. I know my own conversion is due to the prayers of a praying mother.</p><h1>She Was a Wise Woman</h1><p>“<em>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground. But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord. And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these</em>” (Judges 13:20-23).</p><p>Samson’s mother was dedicated, devoted, and wise. A mother’s wisdom is invaluable. No matter what age you are you have been acquainted with a mother’s wisdom.</p><p>When the angel first appeared to her, she went and told her husband about it. Manoah prayed that the angel would appear again and give instructions. The angel appeared to Manoah’s wife a second time, and she went and received her husband. Once the angel had told them what type of lifestyle that mother and child were to have, and had received the sacrificial offering and left, Manoah thought they were going to die. However, Manoah’s wife had enough wisdom to know that God wasn’t going to kill them. Her words of wisdom comforted her husband.</p><p>Manoah feared the Lord, but His wife was comforted by it. We need a healthy, balanced response to the presence of the Lord. God is to be feared, but we are also to be comforted. How many have been comforted by the words of your mother? Mothers have a way of saying the right thing at the right time. Just when we feel anxious and afraid, a mother can comfort and soothe.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Samson’s feats and victories can easily be traced to the home life that he had. God’s anointing came upon him due to the fact that his parents were consecrated. Manoah’s faithfulness and his wife’s holiness play a major part in Samson’s victories. Samson could be thankful that God had endowed him with such power, but Samson could thank his parents for giving him a living example of how to be strong in a spiritually weak culture. My life was greatly impacted by hearing my mother pray and worship. Her faithfulness and holiness in the face of great adversity gave me hope. I may not have understood it as a child but as an adult I can look back and be appreciative of her holy example.</p><p>We tend to over analyze people’s failures with pop psychology these days. There is a tendency in wanting to place the blame of people’s poor choices on their up bringing. And this may be why God gives us such a great glimpse into the lives of Manoah and his wife. Samson couldn’t blame his home life for his failures. His mother and father were godly and raised him according to God’s commands. Samson could be thankful that his parent’s example played a part in his victories, but Samson couldn’t blame his parents for his failures. Chapter 14 leads us to believe that Samson’s parents had constantly reminded him about not dating heathen girls (Judges 14:3). Samson’s future mistakes couldn’t be hung on the idea that his parents didn’t raise him correctly. Samson couldn’t blame his parents for not giving him a holy example. Samson’s problems were directly the result of human depravity. Certainly there are innumerable cases of people’s childhoods being less than ideal. I wouldn’t take such arguments lightly due to the fact that I myself had an alcoholic father who never darkened the door of any church my entire lifetime. However my bad choices and mistakes can’t be blamed on my father.</p><p>She was nameless, but faithful. Faithful despite her disappointment. Faithful in her dedication. Faithful in her devotion. We live in a culture that does not appreciate obscurity. Social media has removed obscurity, and put everything out in the open. It’s about how many followers you have on Twitter and Instagram. It’s about how many friends you have on Facebook. How many likes your page or post can get. I’m not necessarily diminishing these things. However, some feel as if they aren’t recognized then they aren’t making any difference.</p><p>But ask Manoah and Samson if this woman of faith made a difference. Ask Israel if this woman of faith had made any difference. Ask the Philistines if this woman of faith had made a difference.</p><p><strong>Obscurity is not an obstacle to faithfulness</strong>. Whether or not the world knows the good you are doing or not, does not mean that God isn’t taking inventory of your life.</p><p>There is only one Name that is worthy of glory and fame, and that is Jesus Christ. Our task is to do everything in the Name of Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 10:31). One day every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess the Name of Jesus (Php. 2:10).</p>	100	\N	Nameless, but Faithful	\N	/hernan-sanchez-172305-unsplash.jpg

After joining the Nazi party primarily for political purposes, he staffed his factory with Jewish workers for similarly pragmatic reasons. When the SS began exterminating Jews, Schindler arranged to have his workers protected to keep his factory in operation, but soon realized that in so doing, he was also saving innocent lives. When the war was ending, and he had saved many lives, he cried out “I could have done more.” Schindler had saved countless lives, but he felt he could have saved more.</p><p>Regret is one of the most galling emotions. Some feel regret over for the mistakes they have made. Others feel regret for the things they didn’t accomplish. I’ve heard it said, “It’s better to regret something you did, than something you didn’t do.” To avoid the feeling of regretting something you didn’t do, you must finish well.</p><p>Today we are celebrating our senior class. Four young men, who have finished well. Some have been at Apostolic Christian School for only a short time. Others have been here the majority of their life. They have endured classes, homework, projects, and tests. In addition to the academic disciplines, they have endured peer pressure, family issues, personal turmoil, and have overcome obstacles that only a select few are aware of. Together they have finished well.</p><p>Just as they are finishing this phase of their life , they are about to embark on a new journey that demands that they finish well. Trust me when I say, that it may feel like the last eighteen years of your life have moved at the pace of a slug, the next eighteen years will fly by faster than a jet airplane. It is important that you take what you have been taught here, and apply it to the next portion of your life, so you may finish well.</p><p>In Acts chapter twenty the Apostle Paul is about the leave the Ephesian church that he started. His mission at Ephesus was about complete. Paul doesn’t believe that he will see them again (Acts 20:25). As Paul is about to leave for Jerusalem and meet his fate there, he gives an overview of what he had accomplished in that place.</p><p>“But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (Acts 20:24).</p><p>I want to look at a few points within this farewell address and see how you can finish well.</p><h1>1. Finishing Well Means Being Cautious</h1><h2>A. Be Cautious of What You Love</h2><p>“And when they came to him, he said to them: &#8220;You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews” (Acts 20:18-19).</p><p>As you take the next steps you must be mindful of your surroundings, and emotions. When Israel was ransacked by Nebuchadnezzar they brought the best of the young people to Babylon first. They wanted them to be awed at the beauty and splendor of Babylon (Dan. 1:1-5). Like Daniel, and his friends, you must have your convictions settled now. The seduction of your emotions and feelings are powerful, whether you are on a college campus, a full time job, or in the company of beautiful people.</p><p>Paul knew his surroundings in Ephesus were dangerous. The Gentile people loved their pagan gods and idols (Acts 19:21-41). The Jews were also hostile towards Paul’s teaching about Jesus (Acts 20:19). Despite this Paul preached Christ to the people in Ephesus (Acts 20:20-21). Paul cared more about pleasing God, than pleasing men. Paul didn’t count his life of any value, rather he was committed to the task of winning souls, and loving Jesus.</p><h2>B. Be Cautious in What Motivates You</h2><p>Your motives can and will be seduced. Are you motived to make more money? Are you motivated to become more popular? Are you motivated to simply find a companion? Your affections are powerful weapons that the enemy of your soul would like use against you.</p><p>Paul says, “I coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel” (Acts 20:33). Paul wasn’t motivated by money. Paul was motivated by pleasing God. For you to finish well you must be motivated to please God in all of your decisions.</p><p>“You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’” (Acts 20:34-35).</p><p>Paul worked hard, but he didn’t work hard to simply make more money. Rather, he worked hard to help the weak. In other words, Paul worked hard so he could serve others, and serve his God-given purpose. Paul refers to what Jesus said, “It is more blessed to given than to receive.” Finishing well is about giving. Giving involves the giving of your time, abundance, and life. No one at the end of their life regrets giving, they may regret that they didn’t give more. They regret not spending more time with their family. They regret not giving more to the Kingdom of God. They regret not praying more. If you are going to finish well, you must know what motivates you.</p><h2>C. Be Cautious in What Masters You</h2><p>The natural process from high school to secondary schooling, whether on a college campus or a trade school, is to become a master in the discipline you want to pursue. To be successful you need to become a master. On the other hand you must be cautious of what masters you.</p><p>Many have left the safe confines of a Christian school to be exposed to various ideas and philosophies, only to become enslaved to them. Atheism, agnosticism, and a myriad of anti-Christ philosophies have become the loudest voices on many college campuses, and even in the work place. The friends you keep, and the crowd you associate with will want to influence your life. Will you be mastered by peer pressure and cultural acceptance? Or will you be a mastered by your faith in Christ?</p><p>Paul was a servant of Jesus Christ (Rom. 1:1; Acts 20:19); and he was a servant to all (1 Cor. 9:19). Paul’s master was none other than Jesus Christ, and he mastered to the cause of saving as many people as possible (1 Cor. 9:22). If you will submit yourself to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and to His will, then you will undoubtedly finish well.</p><h1>2. Finishing Well Means Laboring Well</h1><h2>A. Labor With Passion</h2><p>“Serving the Lord with all humility and with tears” (Acts 20:19a). “Remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears” (Acts 20:31).</p><p>To say that Paul was passionate about preaching the gospel would be an understatement. Finishing well demands that we labor with passion. Passion will push you through obstacles and resistance.</p><p>“But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me” (1 Corinthians 15:10).</p><p>The King James Version translated it as “labored more abundantly.” The Greek definition of “more abundantly” means “greater” “super abundant” or “exceedingly.” Passion produces a healthy work ethic. Whatever you pursue in this next stage of your life, pursue it with passion.</p><p>Paul labored with tears in his eyes, because within Paul’s heart was a passion to win as many lost souls as he could. What others seen as weakness in Paul (2 Cor. 10:10), God viewed as passion.</p><p>Read of Paul’s passion: “For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1 Corinthians 2:2). Again he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 3:14). Paul was obsessed with his call.</p><p>A passion to make a worthwhile difference is indispensable to effectiveness. Passion and vision need to work together. Passion energizes vision, and vision disciplines the passion. The clearer the vision, the greater the passion.</p><h2>B. Labor with Purpose</h2><p>“How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house. Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:20, 26-27).</p><p>Twice Paul said that he didn’t “shrink” from preaching the gospel. To “shrink from” means to “draw back” “avoid” or “hesitate.” Paul labored with a purpose. Nothing was going to stand in his way, no matter the cost. Whether it was pagan idolatry, or Judaizers desiring to go back under the Law of Moses, he was not going to be dissuaded. He was going to preach day and night, and in public and in private. That’s laboring with a purpose.</p><h1>Finishing Well</h1><p>Paul wrote to Timothy towards the conclusion of his life, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith” (2 Timothy 4:7).</p><p>Three things we see that Paul did to finish well:</p><p>•I have fought the good fight</p><p>•I have finished the race</p><p>•I have kept the faith</p><h2>Fought the Good Fight</h2><p>The phrase “have fought” and “fight” in the Greek means “agony” or “agonize.” Both words that Paul used were in reference to athletic training. In essence Paul was saying that he used great effort and energy in defending the faith. Paul admonished in Timothy to also fight the good fight of faith (1 Tim. 6:12).</p><p>We are to earnestly contend for the faith (Jude 1:3). Like Paul and Timothy, we are to give our energy and effort in living out the faith, preserving the faith, and defending the faith. To do so is to finish well.</p><h2>Finished the Race</h2><p>To avoid wandering from the faith, you must have the discipline to stay the course. The word “race” or “course” (as some translations use) means in the original language refers to the running a race, fulfilling a calling, or military service. Paul used this same terminology when addressing the Ephesians elders (Acts 20:24).</p><p>The writer of Hebrews admonishes Christian believers to lay aside any weight or sin that may hinder their endurance to finish the race set before them (Heb. 12:1). If you are going to finish the course, and endure the race, you must lay aside any encumbrances that cause you to stumble.</p><h2>Kept the Faith</h2><p>Finally, Paul said that he “kept the faith” (2 Tim. 4:7). In the Greek the phrase “have kept” carries the idea of “watching over” or “preserving.” Earlier in this same letter Paul tells Timothy to “guard the good deposit entrusted to you” (2 Tim. 1:14). The definition in Greek of “to guard” was a military term used for a soldier to be on watch for that which had been entrusted to him. Paul had kept the faith, and wanted Timothy to keep it as well. Do not forsake, or neglect the faith that you have been taught. You are to guard it like it’s a treasure.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Bible commentator, John MacArthur” relates a story to Paul’s farewell:</p><p>“In 1904, William Borden, a member of the Borden dairy family, finished high school in Chicago and was given a world cruise as a graduation present. Particularly while traveling through the Near East and Far East, he became heavily burdened for the lost. After returning home, he spent seven years at Princeton University, the first four in undergraduate work and the last three in seminary. While in school, he penned these words in the back of his Bible: “No reserves.” Although his family pleaded with him to take control of the business, which was foundering, he insisted that God’s call to the mission field had priority. After disposing of his wealth, he added “No retreat” after “No reserves.” On his way to China to witness to Muslims there, he contracted cerebral meningitis in Egypt and died within a month. After his death, someone looking through his Bible discovered these final words: “No regrets.” He knew that the Lord does not require success, only faithfulness.”</p><p>*This was written and used in our Christian school&#8217;s final chapel service celebrating our senior class*</p>	100	\N	Finishing Well	\N	/img_1706.jpg
636	2019-04-29 02:22:29	\N	\N	\N	<p>One of the most common questions pastors and ministers get asked is, “What is the will of God for my life?” Those who want to please God want to take into consideration God’s will. A lot of bad decisions could be avoided if the will of God was taken into consideration. Most trouble, much heart ache, and disappointment could be avoided if the will of God was considered.</p><p>The majority of my ministry has been working with young people. The question more than any other that I have been asked is, “What is God’s will?”</p><p>•What college should I go to?</p><p>•What career path should I take?</p><p>•Should I date this person?</p><p>•Who am I going to marry?</p><p>•Where am I going to live?</p><p>Maybe you have asked these questions, and similar questions as an adult:</p><p>•Should I take this job?</p><p>•Should we have children, if so how many?</p><p>•Should I go back to school?</p><p>•Should I marry this person?</p><p>•Should I invest in this business venture?</p><p>•Should I move to another state to take a promotion?</p><p>I think all of us have been presented with these types of questions. And we’ve all been introduced to the fear, anxiety, and worry of answering these questions in connection to God’s will.</p><p>Listen to what Paul said concerning the Christian&#8217;s walk with God, and knowing the will of God:</p><p>&#8220;See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭5:15-20‬ ).‬‬</p><p>Our key thought for this study is about knowing God’s will for your life. However, as I studied this portion of text, it seems to ask this question in a different more effect way. Instead of asking “What is God’s will for my life,” it could be asked, “What is always God’s will?” From this portion of Ephesians five, and in the larger part of the letter, we can see what is always God’s will. If we can answer what is God’s will always, we can have assurance that we are doing God’s will. However, if what we are shown from this text is doing something other than that what God’s will is, then we may be ultimately not doing God’s will.</p><h1>1. Walk in Wisdom</h1><p>“<em>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise</em>,” (Ephesians 5:15).</p><p>The Apostle Paul wrote much about the Christian’s walk. Often, we as Apostolic Pentecostals, are concerned with shouting and dancing. We place a lot of emphasis on whether or not someone shouts or dances in the Spirit. Those are responses to the Spirit’s moving in a church service, or time of prayer. On the other hand, we should be more concerned with how we live, or walk, according to the Spirit. The Spirit, as we will see in this text, should influence our daily walk more than it does our intermittent shout.</p><p>Paul extensively wrote about walking throughout his letters to the Christian churches:</p><p>•Walk in the steps of faith (Rom. 4:12)</p><p>•Walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4)</p><p>•Walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit (Rom. 8:1; Gal. 5:16)</p><p>•Walk honestly (Rom. 13:13)</p><p>•Walk by faith, and not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7)</p><p>•Walk differently from the Gentiles or surrounding culture (Eph. 4:17)</p><p>•Walk in love (Eph. 5:2)</p><p>•Walk in light, and not in darkness (Eph. 5:8)</p><p>•Walk circumspectly (carefully) (Eph. 5:15)</p><p>•Walk worthy of the Lord, pleasing Him (Col. 1:10)</p><p>•Walk in wisdom (Col. 4:5)</p><p>The Apostle John added:</p><p>•Walk as Jesus walked (1 Jn. 2:6)</p><p>•Walk according to the commandments (2 Jn. 1:6)</p><p>•Walk in truth (3 Jn. 1:3)</p><p><strong>The will of God will determine your walk, and your walk will determine God’s will for your life. </strong></p><p>Here Paul says we are to walk circumspectly (Eph. 5:15a). The word “circumspectly” in the Greek means to walk carefully. Each step that we take in discerning the will of the Lord should be done with care and caution. This means to slow down and analyze your next step. Too many want to rush into doing something. They take very little time to weigh the pros and cons. They are led by impulse and not led by divine inspiration. Now, this is not to mean that we are to take every trivial decision and allow it to paralyze us. As we are going to see there are certain things we can do to help us determine God’s will in both the small and large matters of our life.</p><h2>A. Not Foolish, but Wise</h2><p>“<em>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise</em>,” (Ephesians 5:15).</p><p>The first way to know God’s will is to discern if it is foolish or wise. It’s foolish to jump into any decision without planning and preparation.</p><p>“For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace” (Luke 14:28-32).</p><p>It is the wise man or woman who counts the cost, and gets counsel. To avoid, or neglect this is folly. The will of God is never foolish, and it will not lead to foolish living. Now, we must consider that some may think our living for the Lord is foolish. Critics may believe that our desire to live for the Lord, and not for the approval of man, is foolish. But our aim is to please God, and not man.</p><p>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction” (Proverbs 1:7)</p><p>Wisdom is found in fearing the Lord. This is not a fear of God’s retribution, or scorn. Rather, this is a holy awe of God’s wisdom, power, and attributes. It is a desire to worship God with your decision making.</p><p>“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (James 1:5).</p><p>Just as wisdom is vital to decision making, it is the prayerful man and woman who receives it. Counting the cost, and getting counsel is well and good. However, getting on your knees in prayer and seeking God’s will is of utmost importance. If you want wisdom, and desire to avoid foolishness, then pray, count the cost, and seek wise counsel.</p><p><strong>It is always God’s will to use wisdom and avoid foolishness. </strong></p><h2>B. Redeeming the Time</h2><p>“<em>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil</em>” (Ephesians 5:16).</p><p>The most precious commodity that we own is time. It is also the most elusive. You can never earn, or regain time. Paul says that believers are to redeem the time. The word redeem in the Greek is defined as “buying up.” Like a wise investor buying up stocks, the believer is to buy up the time they have been given.</p><p>Many are of the persuasion that they can earn more by working more. This is true in its essence. But you do use the resource of time, and even steal time away from something else. So you may earn more money, or opportunities, but you may have loses in other parts of your life.</p><p>It is always the will of God for you to not waste the valuable time you have been given. If the choice is to work more and not spend time with your wife, then it is a loss. If your decision means neglecting your children, then it’s a loss. If your choice means less time spent in prayer, bible study, and church attendance, then it is a loss in this life, and the life to come. Many have sacrificed families, and spiritual health for the sake of making more money, or having more opportunities to make more money. Or they have gobbled up spiritual opportunities by wasting away time on trifles.</p><p>Jesus said to store up for yourselves riches that cannot be eaten by moth, corroded by time, or be stolen by thieves (Mt. 6:19-20). Your spiritual health, and the family unit should be first and foremost in our decision making.</p><p>Why? Paul says “Because the the days are evil.” Bible commentator, Grant Osborne said, “If the saints are not exceedingly careful to be in control of their time, evil can insert itself and take over.” We mustn’t allow our time to be overcome by worldly pursuits. Our main pursuit should be to glorify God, and we can do that through doing His will.</p><p><strong>It is always God’s will to put Him first in our time. </strong></p><h1>2. Walk in Understanding</h1><p>“<em>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is</em>” (Ephesians 5:17).</p><p>Rather than walking in the ways of this present evil world, we are to be understanding knowing what the will of the Lord is. Fools ignorantly do not believe in God (Ps. 14:1). Paul says in Romans:</p><p>“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools” (Romans 1:21-22).</p><p>Fools ignore God in their unbelief, or they disobey God through their unrighteousness. Therefore, they do not understand the will of God, they are ignorant of it.</p><p>“Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is” (Ephesians 5:17).</p><p>God has made Himself known through His creation (Ps. 19:1; Rom. 1:18-20). He has also made Himself known through His Word.</p><p>Consequently since God has made known His will through His Word, the best way for you to grow in wisdom is to grow in your knowledge of the Bible. To know the will of the Lord, you must know the Word of the Lord. The Lord speaking through the prophet Hosea said, “My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6). Too many well-intentioned believers are destroyed because they lack basic knowledge and understanding of God’s Word. Neglect of Scripture will undoubtedly lead to foolish decision making, and foolish living.</p><p>“<em>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it</em>” (<strong>Matthew 7:24-27</strong>).</p><p><strong>It is always God’s will for you to know God’s Word. If decisions lead you away from the Bible, then it is not the will of the Lord. </strong></p><h2>A. Be Transformed, Not Conformed</h2><p>In Romans Paul dealt with knowing the will of God:</p><p>“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God” (Romans 12:1-2).</p><p>1.Present your bodies as a living sacrifice</p><p>2.Being holy and acceptable</p><p>3.Do not be conformed to this world</p><p>4.Be transformed in your mind</p><p>This is God’s will, and if you will understand this, you will be in God’s will. If what you are facing leads to compromising your holiness; if it means an acceptance of of the world’s thinking, then it is not God’s will for your life.</p><p><strong>God’s will is for you to always be holy, not be conformed to this world, and be transformed in your mind. </strong></p><h1>3. Walk in the Spirit</h1><p>“<em>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit</em>” (Ephesians 5:18).</p><p>Paul uses a parallel between being under the influence of alcohol, and being under the influence of the Spirit. Perhaps you have seen someone under the influence of liquor. Drinking has an influence on a person’s behavior, temperament, and actions. A man who is quiet can become loud and obnoxious under the influence of strong drink. A moral man when sober, can become immoral with a drink. A man who is usually strong and stable could become a sobbing child under the influence of liquor. A filthy minded man who has come under the influence of alcohol can sing hymns that he was taught as a child.</p><p>A person doesn’t stay under the influence of alcohol perpetually. They have to constantly drink in order to get the same high or low they are looking for.</p><p>To contrast this Paul says we are to be filled with the Spirit. A person who has come under the influence of the Holy Spirit doesn’t behave the same way they used to. The man who was loud and obnoxious has become calm, cool and respectable under the influence of the Spirit. The man who was immoral can now become a man of character and morality under the influence of the Spirit. The woman who was angry and jealous, can become loving and kind under the influence of the Spirit.</p><p>Again, the parallel continues. Just a person cannot stay drunk, they have to continually drink to be under its influence. And if they are always drinking alcohol it effects their health and well-being. The believer that has been baptized in the Spirit, just as the Book of Acts portrays, must continually be “filled” with the Spirit. If you are to continually walk in the Spirit, you must be continually filled with the Spirit. Unlike alcohol, the Holy Spirit does not destroy health and vitality. No, the Holy Spirit gives life, and joy! This is not some second work of the Holy Spirit, or a second blessing. No, this is coming under the control and influence of the Spirit.</p><p><strong>It is alway’s God’s will for you to be filled, and influenced by the Holy Spirit. </strong></p><h2>A. Speak and Sing</h2><p>“<em>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord</em>” (Ephesians 5:19).</p><p>Those who are under the influence of alcohol usually say things they wouldn’t normally say. They lose all inhibitions. But the believer who is continually being filled with the Spirit has their speech changed too. Jesus said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Mt. 12:34b)! The Holy Spirit will give you a song in your heart, and a praise on your lips.</p><p>If your heart is under the influence of anything other than the Holy Spirit then it will lead you down many wrong paths. The heart is deceitful and no one can discern it (Jer. 17:19).</p><h2>B. Praise and Worship</h2><p>“<em>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>” (Ephesians 5:20).</p><p>It is always the will of God for you to give praise and worship.</p><p>“In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p><p>I&#8217;ve seen many saints go from exuberant worship to sitting in the back row with their arms crossed. Something has stolen their song, and robbed them of their praise. It can usually be traced back to a decision or choice that has hindered their walk with the Lord. Most don&#8217;t backslide over night. Instead it is gradual regression made over time through the means of bad choices.</p><p><strong>If your choices steal your praise and worship, then its not the will of God. It is always God’s will for you to praise. </strong></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>To summarize our study of Ephesians 5:15-20:</p><h3>Always God’s Will</h3><p>•It is God’s will to use wisdom and avoid foolishness.</p><p>•It is God’s will to put Him first in our time.</p><p>•It is God’s will for you to know and understand His Word</p><p>•It is God’s will to be holy, to be separate, and having transformed thinking.</p><p>•It is God’s will for you to be filled, and influenced with His Spirit.</p><p>•It is God’s will for you to praise and worship.</p><h3>Never God’s Will</h3><p>•If it leads to foolishness then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>•If it takes away your time spent for the Lord then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>•If it leads you away from the Bible then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>•If it causes you to compromise your holiness or convictions then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>•If it leads to being under the influence of anything other than the Holy Spirit then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>•If it keeps you from having a holy melody in your heart, or praising the Lord then it’s not God’s will.</p><p>Ask and answer these questions if you are searching for the will of God.</p>	100	\N	Knowing The Will of God	\N	/img_1699.jpg
637	2019-04-10 16:05:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; And the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD OF HOSTS: And all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: And in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts (Zechariah 14:20–21).</p><h2>The Book of Zechariah</h2><p>Zechariah, a priest and prophet, returned to Judah with the other Israelite exiles after their expulsion from the land. King Cyrus of Persia allowed an estimated 50,000 Israelites to return to their homeland to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-4). Zechariah’s ministry was during Ezra’s restoring of the Temple, and Nehemiah’s rebuilding of the city walls. Zechariah was also a contemporary of the prophet Haggai, and together they ministered to the people of Judah.</p><p>Jerusalem and Judah had been previously ransacked and destroyed by Babylonian invaders, and Zechariah’s ministry involved encouraging the people of Judah with the task of rebuilding their homeland and reestablishing their identity.</p><p>Bible commentator, John MacArthur notes, “<em>Zechariah joined Haggai in rousing the people from their indifference, challenging them to resume the building of the temple. Haggai’s primary purpose was to rebuild the temple; his preaching has a tone of rebuke for the people’s indifference, sin, and lack of trust in God. He was used to start the revival, while Zechariah was used to keep it going strong with a more positive emphasis, calling the people to repentance and reassuring them regarding future blessings</em>” (MacArthur Bible Handbook, 2003).</p><h2>The Loss of God’s Glory and Israel’s Holiness</h2><p>After Jerusalem was destroyed, and duringIsrael’s exile, the prophet Ezekiel said that the glory of the Lord had departed the Temple (Ezk. 10:1-19). Ezekiel also prophesied that God’s glory would return to the Temple once it had been restored (Ezk. 43:1-5). When the Israelites returned to Jerusalem and began to rebuild the Temple under the direction of Ezra, they realized the task was more challenging than they first thought. The altar was rebuilt first, along with the foundation stones (Ez. 3:1-4:24). But the Temple would take much longer to rebuild.</p><p>Zechariah wanted to encourage the people to continue building, because along with their rebuilding of the Temple, their identity as God’s people was being restored. Zechariah’s book opens up with a reminder of why they were in this position in the first place.</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers. Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, And I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: But they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the Lord</em>” (Zechariah 1:2–4).</p><p>The former generations rebelled against God and His Word, which led to their demise, and the loss of their holiness. The Assyrians destroyed Samaria and the Northern Tribes of Israel, and the Babylonians demolished Jerusalem, and took the last two tribes in Southern Kingdom captive (2 Kings 17:5-23; 25:8-21; 2 Chr. 36:17:20). Before their expulsion from the land, for nearly two hundred years the prophets of Israel preached against Israel’s disobedience, and the ugliness of their sin. The prophets of Israel and Judah wanted nothing more than for God’s people to turn and repent. If Israel would turn and repent, then God would turn to them. All Israel had to do was forsake their sin, and God would in turn return with His glory and give them their distinct identity being God’s holy people.</p><p>As God’s people, Israel was to be set a part. They weren’t to live like they nations that surrounded them. Instead they were to be different. When Israel was brought out of Egypt, and the Lord met with at Sinai, the covenant given was about becoming God’s set apart people.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel&#8221;</em> (Exodus 19:6).</p><p>Israel wasn’t to be isolated, rather they were to be distinct from the rest of the world in which they lived. Their laws, lifestyle, worship, and commitment to the Lord was to be unrivaled. Israel was to be a connection between God and man. Israel was to be the priestly nation. As a priest connected God to man, a priestly nation connects humanity to God. Israel was to be the channel through which God&#8217;s word came to man, through which access to God was made available. They were the preaching, proclaiming, witnessing nation. Instead of being the kingdom of priest, and a holy nation, the people and their false worship around them, became a snare to them. Israel were continually tempted to become like the nations around them. From Judges to Nehemiah the story is a never ending roller coaster of faithfulness, and faithlessness.</p><p>Israel’s relinquished their holiness when they bowed to anything other than the Lord. Israel’s inability to keep her covenant with Yahweh. Paul says it this way:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone&#8221;</em> (Romans 9:31–32).</p><p>Israel’s lack of faithfulness led to their stumbling. Such could be said of many today. Lack of faith produces a lack of righteousness. Holiness is indelibly linked to faith. Sin is the poison of the soul. Whether its disobedience, rebellion, false worship, or a myriad of other shapes and forms that sin takes, it will rob you of your joy, and holiness. The lies that sin promises only leads to misery.</p><p>A friend told me that those who struggle with addiction, seems to always forget the misery. They only remember the short moments of tranquility, and forget the long-term effects of addiction, such as misery, shame, guilt, and the wreckage that sin causes. In the wilderness wanderings Israel only could remember the leeks and onions, and the flesh pots of Egypt. The forgot the whips, chains, and slavery. The leeks and onions took on different forms throughout Israel’s history. The church today is to be a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation</p><h2>The Righteous Branch and the Fountain of Salvation</h2><p>Zechariah’s messages to Judah as they returned to their homeland included many visions and dreams of coming days. Israel needed more than just a better commitment than the previous generations. Trying harder wasn’t going to be the way to holiness. Over and over again Zechariah looks to a new day, a day in which Israel longed for. The majority of Zechariah’s prophecy include the statement, “On that day.” The day of the Lord was Messianic. The promised Messiah was going to come, and he would bring salvation and judgement. Salvation to those who believed, and judgment to those who refused to believe.</p><h3>The Righteous Branch</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, And thy fellows that sit before thee: For they are men wondered at: For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; Upon one stone shall be seven eyes: Behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day&#8221;</em> (Zechariah 3:8–9).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; And he shall grow up out of his place, And he shall build the temple of the Lord: Even he shall build the temple of the Lord; And he shall bear the glory, And shall sit and rule upon his throne; And he shall be a priest upon his throne: And the counsel of peace shall be between them both&#8221;</em> (Zechariah 6:12–13).</p><p>The Righteous Branch would remove iniquity, the Temple would be rebuilt, the glory would return, and holiness would be restored. The future held an even greater blessing, the coming of my servant the Branch, which would result in the complete and instantaneous removal of the iniquity of this land. “The Branch” refers back to the prophecies of Jeremiah. The Lord promised to raise up a righteous “Branch” for David, who would reign with justice and establish salvation for his people.</p><h3>The Fountain of Salvation</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;In that day there shall be a fountain opened To the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem For sin and for uncleanness&#8221;</em> (Zechariah 13:1).</p><p>The repentant people need to be cleansed from their iniquity, so God will open up for them a fountain, from which will flow the running water necessary for ritual purification (see Lev. 14:5; cf. Ezek. 47:1–12; Rev. 22:1–2). The people’s uncleanness came from their worship of idols (Zech. 13:2; cf. Ezek. 36:25).</p><p>Israel, and all of the world, would need the Branch and the Fountain to bring forth healing, and cleansing. The removal of their sin would result in holiness being restored. The Righteous Branch, would lead Israel to repentance, and the fountains of cleansing would be opened up.</p><h2>Bells on Horses and Vessels in God’s House</h2><p>When we get towards the end of this amazing book we find restoration in its fullness.</p><p>The people to whom Zechariah ministered to could look back at a history full of shame. God’s people, and even those who Zechariah ministered to in Jerusalem, had come short of God’s glory. They were even presently discouraged with the difficulty of rebuilding that which was torn down. Many here can look at their past, troubled with a guilt and embarrassment of past failures and mistakes. They see the brokenness, and the wreckage in their present life, and wonder if there’s any hope. Can God offer any hope in the future with a renewed purpose?<br />The prophet Zechariah’s ministry can be summed up like this: The Lord reveals His will; The Lord calls men back to Himself, and provides the way fo their coming; The Lord promises that if they will return, He will return to them, and He does so in the power and might of His own Holy Spirit. Which brings us to the this concluding outcome at the end of his book:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; And the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar. </em><br /><em>Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts: And all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: And in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts</em> (Zechariah 14:20–21).</p><h3>Bells on Horses</h3><p style="text-align: left;"><em>&#8220;In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD&#8221;</em> (Zech. 14:20a)</p><p>The text deals with horses which were unclean under the Mosaic law (Lev. 11:3-8). In Deuteronomy seventeen, there are instructions concerning the future kings of Israel (Deut 17:14-20). One of the laws for the king was that he was not to multiply horses unto himself. Because there was only one place to buy horses and that was Egypt (Duet. 17:16).</p><p>The reference is probably to small metallic plates suspended from the necks or heads of the animals for the sake of ornament and making a tinkling noise when striking against each other. These plates may have had the names of the owners inscribed on them. The inscription “HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD” was that which appeared on the miter of the high priest (cf. Exod 28:36).</p><p>In essence, that which was previously considered unclean, was now considered clean. What was once detestable is now holy. When something is designated “Holy to the Lord” it is given sacred status as part of that which is purified for service within the sacred space of the temple where the Lord’s presence dwelt.</p><p>In the day spoken of in the text, the horses themselves shall be purged from commonness or uncleanness, and their harness shall be dedicated to God as certainly as the vestments of the High Priest himself.</p><p>Throughout Zechariah’s prophecies the horse was used in war like events. Upon the horse was a warrior ready to do battle, and shed blood (Zech. 1:7-17; 6:1-8). A horse that was formerly used to cause blood shed, is now ridden, not by a warrior, but by a worshiper.</p><p>If bells on horses can be made clean, and considered holy, what of the sinner? If the Righteous Branch can make bells on horses holy, can He not make the sinner holy? Can that which was once considered detestable be made holy? Yes!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God</em> (1 Corinthians 6:9–11).</p><h3>Vessels in God’s House</h3><p><em>&#8220;And the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar&#8221;</em> (Zech. 14:20b).</p><p>These common vessels will become as holy as the “sacred bowls” at the perimeter of the altar. These bowls held the blood collected from the offering that was in turn sprinkled on the altar to symbolize the purification that the blood effected (Exod 27:3). They were of inferior kind. Those pots, however, would become like “the bowls before the altar,” i.e., vessels of superior sanctity. These golden bowls held the sacrificial blood for sprinkling upon the altar and they were also used for other libations. The prophet is using comparisons which would be familiar to those who first heard him in order to make his point about the holiness of spiritual Jerusalem.</p><p>These particular pots were once considered inferior to other vessels in God’s Temple. The Righteous Branch can take that what may feel insignificant and make it holy, and useful.</p><p>You may feel inferior to others, but upon you will be inscribed HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD. You have a purpose, but more importantly you are washed and sanctified.</p><h3>Vessels in Your House</h3><p><em>&#8220;Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts&#8221;</em> (Zech. 14:21a).</p><p>Bible Commentator, Jame Smith, writes, “<em>All distinction between sacred and secular shall be a thing of the past. Every vessel (possession) used throughout Messiah’s realm would be devoted to the service of the king. Common, ordinary vessels would be suitable for sacrificial purposes. The basic idea here is that old Levitical distinctions in degrees of holiness in society (priests, Levites, people), temple (outer court, holy place, holy of holies), animals (clean, unclean) would disappear. All shall now be equally holy. Thus Zechariah is making clear that he was not anticipating a restoration of the Mosaic system in the messianic age. Rather he envisions an entirely new worship system</em>” (Smith, J. E., 1994).</p><p>The unclean, the common, and the insignificant will be made holy. This is the cleansing power of Jesus Christ at work. The Israelites looked back at a history of faithlessness, and the present ruin that their past behavior brought about, and seen a future of holiness. Restoration brought about through the Righteous Branch, and the Cleansing Fountain.</p><p>I want to conclude with a comment made on this text from Charles Spurgeon:</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>The simple meaning of the text is just this, that the day shall come when in common life holiness shall be the guiding star, when the ordinary actions of human existence shall be as much the worship of God as the sacrifice of the altar or the mission of the high priest when he went within the vail. Everything, that which was most despised—the horses, the places which seemed the least likely to be consecrated—the stables, and those things which seemed the least holy, even the horses’ harness,—all shall be so thoroughly used in obedience to God’s will that everywhere there shall be written, “Holiness unto Jehovah.” Common things, then, in the day spoken of by Zechariah, are to be dedicated to God and used in his service.</em>”</p><p>You may feel as if you will never be forgiven, then I urge you to come to the cleansing fountain tonight. You may feel as if you will never have a significant role in God’s kingdom again, I urge you to come to turn to the Righteous Branch tonight. You may feel insignificant and overlooked, I implore you to come to the King of the sitting on his throne.</p>	100	\N	Bells on Horses and Vessels in God&#8217;s House	\N	/timothy-muza-133593-unsplash.jpg
586	2020-01-24 20:36:02	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>In Israel’s exodus we see the power of God displayed. In the giving of the Law we see the holiness of God revealed. Please note that the exodus preceded the giving of the Law. The Law wasn’t given first, because the Law couldn’t provide liberty. The Law, rather, provided safety. If God was going to be Israel’s King, and if they were going to be His representatives on the earth, then they were going to need a Law (Ex. 19:5-6)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As citizens of America, we have freedom. There are laws that govern our way of life as free people. Laws, for example, against murder. Freedom may be taken away if someone murders another. We can conclude that the same law that protects, is the same law that punishes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Though the Israelites were freed from Egypt, they were still enslaved to sin. The apostle Paul wrote, “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law” (Rom. 7:7). God, through the Law, revealed what was in the heart of every person. In other words, the Law provided a mirror into man’s heart, which included murder, idolatry, theft, adultery, and so forth (Ex. 20:1-17). The Law didn’t provide a means for salvation. The Tabernacle, and its sacrifices, administered a temporary agency for cleansing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, the Law disclosed God’s holiness and man’s sinfulness. The Law, nevertheless, provided protection for living in God’s kingdom as God’s peculiar people. The same Law that protected, was the same Law that punished. Assuming that Israel kept God’s commands, they would enjoy God’s blessings. If they broke God’s commands, then they would suffer the consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, as New Testament believers, we have a greater law, the law of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). Jesus Christ made us free from the law of sin and death (Rom. 8:3). Jesus accomplished what the Law couldn’t do, He freed us from the enslavement of sin.

587	2020-01-23 17:48:59	\N	\N	\N	<p>The children of Israel proved to have short memories. They forgot about the ten plagues and the exodus from Egypt. The Red Sea parting was a distant memory. Their memory overlooked Marah’s bitter waters turned sweet.</p><p>When Israel arrived at the wilderness of Sin, all of these events had transpired in the last two months (Ex. 16:1). All of God’s blessings and provision couldn’t be recounted when they began to get hungry in the wilderness. Their hunger also seemed to have impacted their reality. For they began to believe that it was better in Egypt than in the wilderness. It’s ironic they could recall the flesh pots in Egypt, but couldn’t remember the whips and chains. Furthermore, it’s sad they could evoke memories of being filled to the full in Egypt, but couldn’t remember God quenching their thirst at Marah.</p><p>God is so gracious and long-suffering! Israel hadn’t been away from Egypt for more than two months and they already wanted to go back. God wasn’t turned off by Israel’s short memory, or lack of gratitude. Rather than lead them back to Egypt, He graciously gave them bread from heaven. The Lord gave them what they needed, and most certainly didn’t deserve.</p><p>Grace was given at the wilderness of Sin. Dear reader, here is the gospel! Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound (Rom. 5:20). The murmuring of sin in our hearts didn’t keep God from giving us what we needed and didn’t deserve. Jesus Christ is the Bread of Life come down from heaven, given to fulfill our soul’s hunger. The manna had to be gathered daily and eaten. Likewise, Jesus Christ, the source of life, must be continually appropriated through faith (Jn. 6:35-51).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 16-18	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-16-18.png
588	2020-01-22 16:25:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>The exodus from Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea proved to be exciting moments for Israel. The wilderness seemed promising to the newly freed people. A song of victory and praise to God burst from the hearts of Moses and Israel.</p><p>Sadly the celebrating didn’t last long. Israel went from singing to murmuring in just three short days. What could possibly steal their joy so quickly? First, there wasn’t any water to be found to quench their thirst. Second, they traveled to a place called Marah only to find bitter water.</p><p>Newly converted Christians enjoy the exhilaration of fleeing sin and their old life. They soon realize, however, the wilderness of life leaves them thirsty. They don’t enjoy the things that used to give them pleasure. Old friends may reject their newfound faith. Soon their new faith doesn’t seem as exciting as before.</p><p>What comes next is the bitterness of trials and tribulations. It would be wise for churches to educate new believers to the reality that being a Christian isn’t without its tests. In reality, new and old Christians can come to the waters of real-life and taste bitterness. Life as a Christian isn’t always sunny. Jesus said, “it rains on the just and the unjust” (Mt. 5:45).</p><p>Moses cried out to God after he tasted the bitter waters of Marah. The Lord shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the water, the waters were made sweet (Ex. 15:25). What a picture of the cross! The cross of Jesus Christ was bitter, but it brought sweet salvation to the sinner. Life after initial salvation may prove to be difficult, but look to the that old rugged cross of Calvary!</p><p>Beloved, look to Calvary when you taste the bitterness of trials. Look to Calvary, and cast the cross into your situation. Trials and tribulations may be bitter, but taste and see that the Lord is still good. The cure for murmuring and bitterness is the cross of Jesus Christ!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 13-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-13-15.png
589	2020-01-21 19:10:36	\N	\N	\N	<p>Moses’ confrontation with Pharaoh came to its climatic finale. The death of the firstborn would be the final plague in Egypt. This final plague involved instructions for Israel. Every Israelite household was to take an unblemished lamb and kill it. Next, they were to take the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of their houses. The Lord said, “For I will through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast.” He continued, “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt” (Ex. 12:12-13).</p><p>In order for the Israelites to be spared from the death angel, an innocent lamb had to be killed. Furthermore, the blood of the lamb had to be applied to the doorposts of the house. It’s one thing to believe that a lamb had to be slain, but to have the blood of the lamb applied to your house is something else altogether.</p><p>Many hold to the truth that Jesus Christ, as the Lamb of God, had to die for the sins of humanity. However, Jesus’ death and resurrection from the dead must be applied to your life. The Israelites could have simply killed the lamb, leaving the blood on the ground. If they failed to apply the blood of the lamb to the doorposts, the death angel would not passover that home. The death angel had to see the blood applied to the home in order for that family to be spared.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, believing in Jesus Christ’s vicarious death and resurrection is vital to salvation. Additionally, you must call upon His name in faith, repent of your sins, be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:21, 36-39; 8:12-17; 10:44-48; 19:1-6). That is the New Testament adaptation of applying the blood of the Lamb to your life.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 11-12	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-11-12.png
590	2020-01-20 18:37:55	\N	\N	\N	<p>The showdown between Moses and Pharaoh was nothing short of amazing. Pharaoh’s refusal to let Israel go had led to four plagues. By this point it seemed like Pharaoh had enough. Pharaoh told Moses, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land” (Ex. 8:25) Pharaoh wanted a compromise, but sacrificing in Egypt wasn’t in the cards for Israel. Moses understood that the Egyptians would abhor the Israelite’s form of worship. Pharaoh relented and said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me” (Ex. 8:28).</p><p>Moses agreed to pray for relief. Moses was the wiser, knowing that Pharaoh wouldn’t keep his end of the bargain. And he was right, Pharaoh didn’t let the people go, he hardened his heart, and a fifth plague of flies brought more destruction.</p><p>Moses warned Pharaoh of a sixth plague, a plague of locusts. Pharaoh was willing to let Israel go, but he questioned Moses, “Tell me who will be going?” Moses replied, “We will go with our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the Lord” (Ex. 10:8-9). Everyone and everything was to go with Israel to worship. Pharaoh had something else in mind: “The Lord be with you &#8211; if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil. No! Have only the men go and worship the Lord, since that’s what you have been asking for” (Ex. 10:10-11). Moses denied Pharaoh’s offer. What followed was the plague of locusts and the plague of darkness. Afterwards, Pharaoh proposed to let everyone go, but Israel was to go without their cattle and livestock. Moses, once more, refused.</p><p>Keep in mind that Pharaoh is a type of the devil. He’s willing to let you worship as long as it’s near to him. But the world abhors true Christian worship and commitment. The devil doesn’t mind if you’re dedicated to God, but just don’t go too far. Just as there was a distinction between Israel and Egypt, there should be a distinction between Christians and the world. Finally, Moses wasn’t going to leave the women and children behind in Egypt. An entire generation would have never learned how to worship if Moses left them behind in Egypt. Worship must be multi-generational.</p><p>Finally, It wasn’t enough for Israel to leave Egypt. They were going to need to offer something in sacrifice. Dear reader, it is never enough to just show up for church, you will need to offer your life as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God (Rom. 12:1).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 7-10	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-7-10.png
591	2020-01-20 15:28:36	\N	\N	\N	<p>The children of Israel groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help went up to God. God heard their groaning and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. God looked upon Israel and was concerned about them (Ex. 2:23-25). God’s plan to rescue Israel from their plight involved a deliverer. What kind of man would God use to bring Israel out from Egypt?</p><p>Enter Moses. Moses was from the tribe of Levi. Part of Pharaoh’s plan to diminish Israel’s growth was to kill any newborn sons (Ex.1:15-22). It was in this perilous context that Moses was born. His mother hid him for three months, but when she couldn’t hide him any longer, she placed the child in a basket and put him in the Nile river. Pharaoh’s daughter heard the cry of the child, and rescued him. Knowing that it was a Hebrew child, she asked her servant (Moses’ sister) to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the child. Unbeknownst to Pharaoh’s daughter, the nurse was Moses’ biological mother. When Moses grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son (Ex. 2:1-10).</p><p>It seems as if Moses is the perfect candidate to be Israel’s deliverer. In fact he attempted to help two Israelite slaves by killing an Egyptian. Rather than become their hero, they despised his efforts, and Pharaoh put a bounty on his head (Ex. 2:11-15). Moses, in fear for his life, fled to Midian, married a priest’s daughter, and worked for his father-in-law.</p><p>Moses was content working for his father-in-law, when the Lord appeared to him in a burning bush. God summoned him to be Israel’s deliverer. However, Moses was blinded by his own flaws. He didn’t believe that Pharaoh would listen to him. He knew Israel would question his authority. Then Moses explained that he had a speech impediment, keeping him from speaking clearly.</p><p>The Lord refuted each of Moses’ objections.The Lord had the right man for the job despite Moses’ feelings of insecurity. Undoubtedly, Israel’s deliverer was an imperfect man. Throughout the Bible, as we will discover, God uses imperfect people to accomplish His perfect will. You may feel overwhelmed by the task God has called you to do. You may even have feelings of insecurity. Keep in mind, Moses was only the vessel God was using. It would be God’s power, however, that brought about the results. Listen to the apostle Paul’s words of encouragement, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us” (2 Cor. 4:7).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-4-61.png
592	2020-01-19 19:41:14	\N	\N	\N	<p>The word “Exodus” means “departure” or “exit.” The book of Exodus is the story of Israel being set free from their enslavement in Egypt. Not only is the book of Exodus the recounting of Israel’s departure, but it is also the story of Israel becoming God’s people.</p><p>Originally, Egypt was a haven for Jacob and his family. But after the death of Joseph, there arose a new Pharaoh that didn’t know Joseph or his family. Pharaoh only seen them as a possible threat. Israel posed a threat to Egypt because they had grown from seventy people, to an estimate of around two million people. To keep Israel from becoming allies with Egypt’s enemies, they put them in chains and made them do rigorous work. Israel was captive in Egypt for four hundred years.</p><p>Have you ever stayed somewhere longer than you intended? That’s the story of Israel in Egypt. It is also the story of humanity and sin. Sin always looks promising. But sin always keeps you longer than you intended. Sin promises pleasure and happiness. Consequently, you end up enslaved to sin, and what was once pleasurable has become your prison.</p><p>Israel cried out to God for deliverance, and He heard them and set them free. Dear reader, if you are in need of God’s delivering power, all you have to do is cry out to Him, and He will set you free. But the story doesn’t end there! The exodus from Egypt was just the beginning of Israel’s story. Your redemption from sin is the just beginning of your story too. There is much more to come!</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Exodus 1-3	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Exodus-1-3.png

594	2020-01-16 15:20:50	\N	\N	\N	<p>Joseph might be the most vivid type of Christ in the Old Testament. Joseph was beloved by his father (Gen. 37:3-4). He was hated and rejected by his brothers (Gen. 37:8). He was believed to be dead, but actually alive (Gen. 45:28). While his own people believed him to be dead, Joseph saved a Gentile people, and married a Gentile bride (Gen. 41:50; 47:25). Finally, he revealed himself to his brethren, forgave them, and eventually saved them too (Gen. 45:3,7).</p><p>Jesus is beloved by the Father (Matt. 3:17). Jesus was hated and rejected by his own brothers and people (Isa. 53:3; Jn. 1:11). Jesus died, and was resurrected from the dead (Rev. 1:18). Jesus saves, and marries the Gentiles (Hos. 2:23; Rom. 9:24-33; 15:12). Finally, Jesus will reveal Himself to His brethren where they will look with amazement at His wounds (Zech. 12:10; 13:6). Jesus Christ will forgive Israel and eventually extend salvation to them (Isa. 66:8; Matt. 23:39; Rom. 11:26-29).</p><p>Such typology sheds light upon Genesis 47:25: “And they said, Thou hast saved our lives; let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” Joseph had preserved the Egyptian people during the famine.</p><p>Our “Joseph” has saved us! We have found grace in His sight. Like the Egyptians, we owe our salvation to the Savior. The Egyptians were powerless and hopeless, but God raised up a savior who preserved them. Likewise, we were unable to save ourselves from the consequences of sin. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace, we have been saved (Eph. 2:4-5)! Now let us become Christ&#8217;s faithful servants.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 46-47	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-46-47.png
595	2020-01-15 15:24:25	\N	\N	\N	<p>The seven years of plenty had come and gone just as Joseph had said. Consequently, the seven years of famine were in full-swing (Gen 41:53-54). Jacob and his family began to experience hunger as a result of the famine. Word travelled that there was food available in Egypt, they just needed to go see the man overseeing the distribution (Gen 42:2).</p><p>Twenty-two years had passed since Joseph’s brothers had thrown him into a pit and sold him to Ishmaelite traders (Gen. 37:1; 41;46; 45:11). They didn’t recognize that the man they bowed to was their brother. The series of events that transpire in our reading today reveal the regret of Joseph’s brothers, and their fear of retribution.</p><p>After Joseph put them in prison for three days accusing them of being spies they said, “We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us” (Gen. 42:21). They reluctantly brought Benjamin the next time they came to get food. Obviously they were fearful of Joseph because the money from the first trip was found in their sacks when they arrived back home (Gen. 43:18). Joseph tricked them again by placing a golden cup in the sack of Benjamin, then demanded that he stay as a prisoner for the wrongdoing. Judah, one of Joseph’s older brothers said, “God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants” (Gen. 44:16). Much later in the story, when Jacob died in Egypt, the brothers said, “Joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him” (Gen. 50:15).</p><p>We may not exactly relate to Joseph’s brothers at this point. But we’ve all felt the weight of regret of past mistakes. Commonly, we may feel like something bad is right around the corner to pay us back for our failures. This is known as retribution. We fear that we are going to get what we deserve. However, Joseph forgave his brothers for their misconduct. They didn’t get what they deserved!</p><p>Beloved, this a beautiful picture of God’s grace to sinners. Our sin deserves the wrath of God. While we may fear the payback of our past failures, we can find rest that God has not given us what we deserve. Instead, God extends His love to us, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, and saved from His wrath (Rom. 5:8-9).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 43-45	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-43-45.png
596	2020-01-14 15:41:24	\N	\N	\N	<p>Our memory can be our worst enemy. Old wounds and hurts are not easily forgotten. Failures and regrets haunt us like ghosts. Perhaps you can relate to Joseph in some way. He had suffered rejection, been lied about, and forgotten in prison. Those events can’t be erased from your memory like old data on a computer. While we may not be able to erase those memories, we can’t allow them to keep us from moving forward.</p><p>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had a troubling dream that needed interpreted. The magicians and wise men of Egypt were unable to interpret the dream. The chief butler, who at one time shared a prison cell with Joseph, and who had forgotten him for awhile, finally remembered Joseph. Pharaoh’s butler said, “Pharaoh was wroth with his servant, and put me in ward in the captain of the guards’ house, both me and the chief baker: And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.” He explained that Joseph had correctly interpreted their dreams, and both dreams came to pass.</p><p>Pharaoh didn’t hesitate to call for Joseph to come interpret the dream. Joseph’s previous trials had been preparing him for this moment. Joseph didn’t sulk in the pain of his past. Alternatively, Joseph shaved himself, changed his clothes and went to Pharaoh. Upon hearing Joseph’s interpretation of the dream, and his wise counsel, Pharaoh promoted him to second in command in all of Egypt.</p><p>Joseph overseen the seven years of harvest in Egypt, and prepared for the seven years of famine. He married an Egyptian girl who gave Joseph two sons &#8211; Manasseh and Ephraim. The names are significant. Manasseh means to “forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” Ephraim means &#8220;For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.”</p><p>If your present and future are going to be fruitful, then you need to forget your past. Your past has played an important role in who you are today. You can either allow those hurts to paralyze you, or propel you to your future. You can either allow your past failures to cripple you, or compel you to move on. You can’t be fruitful, unless you learn how to be forgetful.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 41-42	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-41-42.png
597	2020-01-13 17:38:15	\N	\N	\N	<p>Jacob had twelve sons altogether with Leah, Rachel, and their respective handmaids. But it was Rachel’s sons that had a special place in Jacob’s heart. Joseph was definitely Jacob’s favorite son. He even had a special coat of many colors made for Joseph (Gen. 37:3). Joseph’s brothers weren’t as fond of Joseph as Jacob was. Joseph didn’t help matters by disclosing that he had dreams suggesting that his family would one day bow down in front of him.</p><p>One day Jacob sent Joseph to go check on his older brothers while they were tending to their father’s flock. When they saw Joseph afar off, they conspired to kill him! Their hatred went beyond just putting Joseph in a headlock and giving him a noogie. Joseph’s brothers wanted to rid themselves of daddy’s favorite son. Rueben, the eldest brother, warned them to not kill Joseph. Instead, they tore his coat off, threw him in a pit, sold him to Ishmaelite traders, and dipped his coat in goat’s blood. Directly upon arriving at Jacob’s house, his sons showed him the blood-drenched coat. Jacob immediately jumped to the conclusion that Joseph had been slain an evil beast. Of course the boys weren’t going to risk telling the truth that they sold him. They let the old man believe that Joseph was dead.</p><p>The Lord was with Joseph despite his predicament. He was sold as a slave in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh. Joseph had the Lord’s favor and was promoted to be an overseer in Potiphar’s house. Tragically, Potiphar’s wife desired to have an illicit affair with Joseph. The young man refused her temptations day by day.</p><p>Joseph could have looked at the dilemma of his life and succumbed to the seduction of Egypt. His family rejected him, he was a slave in a far off country, and he was experiencing some success. Except Joseph refused the enticement of relinquishing his character and integrity. Joseph would rather risk success, pleasure, and eventually freedom, than sin against God.</p><p>Dear readers, we can all learn from Joseph. The tragedies and disappointments of our lives do not give us the right to sin. All of us have the choice to live godly. It has been said, reputation and integrity take a lifetime to build, and can be lost in a moment.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 37-40	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-37-40.png
598	2020-01-12 22:41:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>Initially when Jacob came to Bethel he had just fled from Esau (Gen. 28). It was late in the evening when he arrived at that sacred place. He laid his head on a pile of stones and dreamed of a ladder set on the earth reaching to heaven. Angels were ascending and descending on that heavenly ladder. At the top of the ladder the Lord stood and spoke to Jacob, “I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac.” This was the first time Jacob had a personal encounter with the God of his fathers. It was there that Jacob made a vow unto the Lord and erected a pillar from the stone pillows that he had laid upon during the dream (Gen. 28:11-22).</p><p>Jacob didn’t inherit faith from Abraham and Isaac. Jacob needed to have his own encounter with the Lord. Beloved, you can’t inherit faith from your parents or grandparents. You need to have your own Bethel where you come into contact with the God of your fathers. You don’t receive salvation just because your parents are saved. Jesus said, “You must be born again” (Jn. 3:3-5). Your first birth doesn’t give you claim to someone else’s salvation.</p><p>Twenty years after that initial meeting at Bethel, the Lord told Jacob to go back. Jacob was a single man the last time he was at Bethel. This time he would bring his entire family to the place where he met the Lord. If God’s promises to Abraham were to continue, then Jacob’s family would need to have an encounter too. Jacob instructed his family to “put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments” (Gen. 35:2). Jacob’s family knew something holy was about to take place. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’s God was about to become their God!</p><p>Our families are our greatest mission field. If we fail to take them to the places where we had life changing experiences with God, then it will just be another monument to them. On the other hand, if they can go with us and have the same type of encounter, then they will also inherit the promises of God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 34-36	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-34-36.png

599	2020-01-11 21:12:53	\N	\N	\N	<p>Have you ever had to apologize? Have you ever had to forgive someone? Apologizing and forgiving are two of the hardest burdens you and I will ever have to bear. Pride is what keeps one from apologizing and another from forgiving. They say, “I’m not going to apologize. I didn’t even do anything wrong!” The other says, “They will have to beg for mercy if I’m ever going to forgive them.” Today’s reading is a story of apologizing and forgiveness.</p><p>It had been twenty years since Jacob had deceptively stolen Esau’s blessing. A lot had happened in those twenty years since Isaac and Rebekah advised Jacob to flee from Esau’s revenge (Gen. 27:41-46).</p><p>After Jacob’s departure from Laban, the Lord told Jacob to travel back to his home country (Gen. 31:13). Jacob sent messengers to see if Esau was still upset. Word got back to Jacob that Esau had four hundred men with him to meet Jacob. Jacob’s first impulse was to separate his band into two. If one part of the group was attacked, then the other group could escape. Jacob’s first thought wasn’t to ask Esau for mercy. Jacob’s first plan was to preserve his life. Then Jacob had a better idea: prayer. Jacob decided to pray and remind God of His promises (Gen. 32:9-12). He asked God to deliver him from Esau’s retaliation. Friends, pray when you don’t know what else to do. Prayer can change any situation.</p><p>When Jacob met Esau, he fell down at Esau’s feet. Jacob had made a living by scheming and planning. The best idea Jacob came up with was asking for Esau’s forgiveness. Esau fell upon his brother’s neck and they wept together. Jacob gave a gift to Esau and said, “I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me” (Gen. 33:10) Jacob apologized, and Esau forgave him. When Esau forgave him, Jacob said it was like looking at the face of God.</p><p>Beloved, when we apologize, that’s when we are the most Christian. On the other hand, when we forgive, that’s when we are most like Christ.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 32-33	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-32-33.png
600	2020-01-10 15:33:10	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>What are we to make of Jacob and Laban’s feud? This whole story sounds like something out of an Andy Griffith Show episode. I’m not sure if Mayberry’s wise sheriff could solve what ensues in this affair. Here are two cheaters trying to hustle one another. It’s a rather humorous event!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob fled to his uncle Laban’s house in an attempt to avoid Esau’s revenge for stealing the patriarchal blessing. Immediately upon arriving to his uncle’s town, Jacob fell in love with Laban’s youngest daughter Rachel. Jacob agreed to work for Laban in order to marry her. After working seven years, on the wedding night, Laban replaced Rachel with his eldest, and less attractive daughter, Leah. Jacob didn’t realize he’d been duped until the next morning. Jacob was going to have to work an additional seven years to marry Rachel, because apparently the youngest daughter couldn’t get married before the eldest daughter. Jacob probably said, “That would have been nice information to have known seven years ago, Laban.” Jacob complied to work seven more years. In the meantime, Leah and Rachel began feuding over who was the better wife and mother. Plus Jacob had to work six more years to grow his own wealth from Laban’s flock. Jacob had trouble doing that because Laban changed his wages ten times! Miraculously, Jacob generated a special type of sheep breed to call his own, and decided to leave with his family in the middle of the night. But to make matters worse, Rachel stole some of her father’s idols as they flew the coop.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully the Scriptures don&#8217;t leave anything out in the stories of its heroes. If it weren’t for episodes found in Genesis 30 and 31 we might be led to believe that God can only use perfect people without any problems. Scripture reveals that God can use anybody, especially those with less than stellar backgrounds. Friends, the supposed heroes of the faith are more like us than we realize. They had family problems. They had children misbehave. They had financial struggles. They had jobs they hated. They had failures. The Bible is full of broken people that God chose, loved, and fulfilled His purpose. And for that we can be hopeful.</p>\r\n	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 30-31	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-30-31.png
601	2020-01-09 17:06:39	\N	\N	\N	<p>Have you ever wondered why Scripture says to walk by faith and not by sight (2 Cor. 5:7)? The answer is that our senses can be deceived. In Genesis 27 we witness the deception of the senses. Isaac is 137 years old, and he feels as if he is about to die (Gen. 27:1). Ishmael, his half brother, had died at that same age, so Isaac figured he’d die at that age also (Gen. 25:17). But Isaac doesn’t die until the age of 180 (Gen. 35:28-29)! Isaac’s self-perception is off. On account of this, Isaac desired to give Esau the patriarchal blessing.</p><p>Rebekah is afraid that Jacob will be left out. So when Esau goes hunting for his father’s favorite venison to cook, she concocts a plan to deceive Isaac. She sent Jacob to fetch a goat to cook instead. How long had Rebekah been cooking goat and saying it was venison?! Obviously Isaac’s tastebuds were not up to par. Isaac’s eyesight was dim, and Jacob was fearful that Isaac would want to touch him if he couldn’t see well enough. Consequently, Rebekah had Jacob wear the goatskin, but Isaac couldn’t perceive with touch either. When Jacob was close enough for his father to touch him, he even believed Jacob smelled like Esau. Isaac’s nose couldn’t detect a difference between his twin sons.</p><p>But there was one sense that worked for Isaac, and it was his hearing. When Jacob spoke Isaac thought, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (Gen. 27:22). What Isaac heard was correct. Unfortunately, what he felt, smelled, tasted, and seen were out of sorts.</p><p>Hearing is referenced at least 170 times in the New Testament. Ears are referenced 52 times in the New Testament. No less than 15 verses in the New Testament you can find the phrase, “He that hath ears, let him hear”</p><p>Friends, we do not walk by sight. We do not walk by feeling. We do not walk by taste. We do not walk by hunger. We do not walk by touch. We do not walk by smelling. We do not walk by emotions. We are to walk by faith, and faith comes from hearing the Word of God (Rom. 10:17). The Word of God should be the basis of our walk with God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 27-29	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-27-29.png
602	2020-01-08 14:13:46	\N	\N	\N	<p>Isaac the son of Abraham is overshadowed in Scripture. Even though he is considered a Patriarch, he is often overlooked due to the large shadow cast by Abraham and Jacob. Of the three Patriarchs Isaac lived the longest, for he died at the age of 180 years. Abraham died at 175, and Jacob died at 147. Though Isaac lived the longest only one chapter is solely given to Isaac (Gen. 26).</p><p>Isaac had come to the land of Gerar of the Philistines. The reason Isaac had come to this place was due to a famine in the land. Isaac had great possessions of flocks and servants. Consequently those flocks and servants were thirsty due to the famine.</p><p>In order to quench the thirst of his flock and his servants, Isaac didn’t dig new wells but instead chose to re-dig the wells that Abraham had dug in that same region. Somewhere along the way the Philistines had filled Abraham’s wells with dirt and mud. They did their best to keep those wells from being used. When Isaac had arrived at the wells, he had a choice to dig new wells or to get a shovel and begin to unclog the filled wells.</p><p>We are living in a day of spiritual famine. It is necessary that we decide not to dig new wells. Rather, we should re-dig the old wells of our spiritual forefathers. Since it quenched their thirst, it will also quench our thirst.</p><p>We must re-dig the wells of Scriptural truth. Truth never gets stale or molds. But there is the possibility that truth can be forgotten. We must re-dig the old wells of prayer and fasting. We must re-dig the wells of holiness and sanctification. We must re-dig the wells of commitment and dedication. These wells may not look attractive to modern eyes, but they will provide the spiritual nourishment that they yearn for.</p><p>Dear reader, the old wells that quenched the thirst of bygone generations, will be the same wells that quench the thirst of this modern generation. It is up to us to re-dig those wells that have been neglected, and filled with worldliness and carnality.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 25-26	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-25-26.png
607	2020-01-03 17:41:58	\N	\N	\N	<p>Sin increased to the point that it grieved God’s heart. Scripture says that God regretted that He made man in the first place. It got so bad that God decided to rain down judgment. God was going to clear the earth of every living thing. It is a fearful thing to think of God’s long-suffering and mercy wearing thin. And that’s exactly what happened.</p><p>Once more, the the light of God’s grace shone through the darkness of sin. Noah found grace in the eyes of God! Frederick Lehman wrote in his hymn The Love of God is Greater Far, “O love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall forevermore endure.” The love and grace of God reached down into the depths of sin and found a man in order to give him a plan to escape the coming judgment.</p><p>The Lord gave Noah plans to erect an ark, which would keep him and his family during the flood. God didn’t need Noah’s input or opinion concerning the construction of the ark. Noah just needed to believe and build the ark according to plan. Furthermore, if Noah failed to follow the blueprint, he and his family would perish with the rest of the world. Beloved, God doesn’t need our advice or consultation regarding the plan of salvation. Jesus Christ was sent to the world to die for the sins of humanity, and was raised from the dead three days later (1 Cor. 15:1-4). The ark of salvation has already been built! We enter this great salvation through faith in the Son of God, turning from our sins, being baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, and receiving the promise of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38-39; 1 Pt. 3:18-22). To add to, or take away from this blueprint of salvation will cause you to perish with the world.</p><p>Likewise, I’m positive Noah was ridiculed for building an ark. The earth had never experienced any rain, or a flood for that matter. Noah built the ark for nearly one hundred years despite not seeing one drop of rain. The world may mock and say, “where is the sign on His coming?” Beloved, just believe and get in the ark, for His coming will be like a thief in the night, and His judgment will arrive (2 Pt. 3:1-10).</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 7-10	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-7-10.png

604	2020-01-06 14:18:27	\N	\N	\N	<p>Abraham’s nephew, Lot, is an interesting character study. When Lot and Abraham separated he chose to pitch his tent toward Sodom (Gen. 13:12). Sodom was a wicked city filled with sin (Gen. 13:13). The sin was so grievous in Sodom that the Lord decided to destroy it (Gen. 18:20-21). Abraham pleaded with God not to destroy it if He could find ten righteous people dwelling there. Unfortunately, there weren’t ten righteous people to be found in Sodom. Two angels were sent to overthrow the city and to warn Lot.</p><p>In respect to Lot, St. Peter wrote, “For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds” (2 Pt. 2:7-8). On one hand Lot was vexed in his spirit. On the other hand Lot lingered in Sodom despite the warning of imminent destruction (Gen. 19:16). Vexed and lingered. What a paradox!</p><p>Lot was vexed and yet lingered. He was perturbed but he put off. He was tormented but he tarried. He was provoked but he procrastinated. He was harassed but he hesitated. He was worried but he wavered. He was afflicted in his soul but he lingered in Sodom. The angels had to take him by the hand and drag him out of Sodom!</p><p>Beloved, if the Holy Spirit is vexing your heart regarding sin, do not linger. If conviction is gripping your heart it is no time to delay! Run to the place of refuge! Run towards Jesus Christ and put your trust in Him. If He has sent messengers to warn you of coming judgment, do not procrastinate. Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6:2).</p><p>You can linger but time will not linger. Time hastens to the day of the Lord, or to the end of your days. You cannot linger while time moves quickly. You must hasten while you are vexed in your heart and soul.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 19-21	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-19-21.png

The people at Babel were in disobedience and lacked faith. Their intent was to be in one place, with one language, and make a name for themselves. In Genesis chapter twelve we see the contrast of what God’s intentions were through Abraham:</p><ul><li>Go from your fathers house</li><li>Leave your kindred</li><li>And country</li><li>And I WILL make of you a GREAT nation</li><li>I will bless you</li><li>And I will MAKE YOUR NAME GREAT</li></ul><p>God does what man cannot do under the power of the flesh and rebellion. Instead, he accomplishes His will through faith and obedience. God will make a great name for that man of faith and obedience- Abraham. Abraham is the antithesis of Babel. Abraham will multiply as the stars in the heavens and the sand on the shores. This prophetic nation will provide the Savior who will do likewise, be faithful and obey the will of God. The man Christ Jesus will fulfill the promise of Abraham, and Noah, and Adam. Similarly, He will produce sons and daughters of God who will be His image bearers going and doing likewise.</p></div>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 11-15	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-11-15.png

The year ended faster than a Kardashian relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I set out to read fifty books in 2018 and reached my goal. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the books that I read weren&#8217;t written in 2018, it&#8217;s just that I read them this year. There were several standouts and a few duds. My reading list for next year is already growing, along with several roll-over books that I didn&#8217;t get to read this year. <br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class="wp-block-list">  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Biography-N-T-Wright-ebook/dp/B072L5DTCH/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1544217997&#038;sr=8-3&#038;keywords=n.t.+wright">Paul: A Biography by N.T. Wright</a>. This was a highly anticipated release this year, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. Wright has done a masterful job weaving Paul&#8217;s life with Paul&#8217;s theology. It was so good that I&#8217;m going to have to read it again. N.T. Wright should consider changing his name to N.T.

My brother in-law recommended this book. And I&#8217;m glad he did! Pastoring and leading is not for the faint of heart. Chand gets right to the heart of leadership pain, because he gets it.

The life of a pastor can be complex, and if we are not careful we will preach the gospel to others and fail to preach it to ourselves first. Hartman delivers a good punch to the gut in this recommended work for ministers. </li>  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078WG2LHX/ref=x_gr_w_glide?caller=Goodreads&#038;callerLink=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36026861-authorized&#038;tag=x_gr_w_glide-20">Authorized: The Use and Misuse of the King James Bible by Mark L. Ward</a>. Tensions tighten around the debate of which English Bible one should use. Ward is very even handed in his approach of how we should choose English translations of the Bible. The section on &#8220;false friends&#8221; is worth the price of the book.

Ferguson cooks up a masterpiece in Some Pastors and Teachers. It&#8217;s part theology and preaching, with a dash of pastoral insight.

The topic of the Church replacing Israel was a topic I was interested in studying this year.

Heiser requires some heavy lifting in reading this fantastic work. Some of his conclusions will make you have to rethink some of your preconceived notions regarding the supernatural order of the spirit realm, and he makes a compelling case in doing so.

I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a handbook to the Bible like Halley&#8217;s Bible Handbook. It&#8217;s more like Halley&#8217;s younger cooler second cousin.

608	2020-01-02 16:41:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>Once Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, life unexpectedly continued for them. The two of them survived despite the fact that God had told them they would die if they ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Again, God’s grace is on display. Sinful man didn’t get what he inevitably deserved.</p><p>Adam and Eve became parents to two strapping boys. Cain, the first-born, was a man of the field. Abel, the youngest, was a shepherd. There came a moment when they were to present their offerings unto the Lord. Unfortunately, Cain’s offering wasn’t accepted, but Abel’s offering was accepted. God warned Cain that sin was crouching at the door ready to seize him. That’s exactly what happened. Cain murdered his brother in a fit of jealousy. Sin had gone from simply disobeying a command to not eat from a particular tree to murder! If you give sin an inch, it will take a mile.</p><p>Violence and evil spread like fire in the following generations. Man fashioned every evil and despicable thing imaginable. No one can blame television, video games, or the internet for sin’s expansion. Man became a slave to sin, and sin is a ruthless taskmaster.</p><p>Despite sin’s rapid proliferation, two men walked with God &#8211; Enoch and Noah. These two men could have gone with the crowd and became corrupt. Enoch and Noah could have blamed their faults on their family tree. They could have made any viable excuse to walk according to the flesh. Alternatively, these two men walked according to the Spirit. Enoch and Noah walked with and pleased God.</p><p>Beloved, you can walk with God no matter your upbringing, environment, culture, or generation. Stand out from the crowd, and be the counter-culture that gets the attention of God.</p>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible Genesis 4-6	\N	/Daily-Readings-in-the-Bible-Genesis-4-6.png
609	2020-01-02 00:00:47	\N	\N	\N	<p>The first three chapters of Genesis are difficult to write about in a brief manner. So much unfolds in just three short chapters. The reader is introduced to God and His creative power through His spoken word. God’s authority is displayed because whatever He says happens. Light is created. The waters and the sky are separated. Land appears and is separated from the water. Vegetation begins to spring at the command of God’s word. The S<span class="text_exposed_show">un, Moon, and stars put in their respective places. Time begins to tick away through the day and night. Animals and insects begin to populate the earth; birds fly in the air, and fish swim in the waters. </span></p><div class="text_exposed_show"><p>Then there is the creation of mankind. Unlike the rest of creation, God reaches down into the dust of the earth and forms man, and calls him Adam. Adam stands out from the rest of what God has created because he is made in the image of God. Adam becomes a living soul as God breathes into His nostrils. The Creator sees one flaw in His creation, it&#8217;s not good for Adam to be alone. To help Adam’s loneliness God created woman from his rib. Adam cleaves to Eve as they are united in holy union. As God’s image bearers, they are to do as He has done- they are to take dominion of creation and to multiply. Adam and Eve are also given the command not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. To do so would mean certain death. They are free to eat anything else they want, except that tree.</p><p>Genesis chapter one and two are a picture of perfection. But just we step back to admire God’s handiwork, chapter three smears paint on the perfect canvas. The introduction to a deceptive serpent, a disobedient wife, a henpecked husband, and ruination of God’s creation through sin.</p><p>God’s creation is turned upside down when Adam and Eve eat from the forbidden tree. And just when the story is at it’s worst, God comes to look for His children. They are trembling naked and ashamed behind some branches. God listens to their futile excuses, and hands out the punishment for their crimes. But with the punishment comes a promise. The Seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent, and He will be the One who will undo all that sin has ruined.</p><p>Three chapters teeming with perfection, pollution, and promise. What a picture of the Gospel. A perfect God, a polluted world, and a promised Savior!</p></div>	100	\N	Daily Readings in the Bible: Genesis 1-3	\N	/Copy-of-Cream-Gray-Massage-Logo.png
610	2019-12-11 22:54:06	\N	\N	\N	<p>I often get asked about what books I recommend. Most of the time it&#8217;s young ministers looking to begin reading. I&#8217;ve shared the same list for several years, adding and subtracting over time. I want to share that reading list with you, dear readers.</p><p>I have said it before, but it bears repeating: A book recommendation isn&#8217;t necessarily an endorsement of an author&#8217;s theology or viewpoint upon any given topic. I live by the saying, &#8220;take the meat, leave the bones.&#8221; In order for you to know how to discern the meat from the bone is to have deep theological roots, and a personal revelation of what you believe. If you haven&#8217;t studied the Bible thoroughly, and haven&#8217;t prayed enough for the Holy Spirit to enlighten your mind and heart, then I recommend that you read none of these books until you have done so.</p><p>Allow me to quote Charles Spurgeon concerning reading:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The apostle says to Timothy and so he says to every preacher, &#8216;Give thyself unto reading.&#8217; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The man who never reads will never be read; he who never quotes will never be quoted. He who will not use the thoughts of other men’s brains, proves that he has no brains of his own</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>So let us read! Let this be a starting point if you are just beginning.

611	2019-12-11 15:39:05	\N	\N	\N	<p>As the year dwindles down its time I reflect on the top five books that I read for 2019. I read just over thirty books this year. Well short of my intended goal. While working on a teaching series I spent a lot of time in large books of systematic theology. I read a lot of content this year, I just didn&#8217;t get through as many books. With that in mind, I&#8217;m only sharing the top five books of 2019. These five books were so good that I felt I would do injustice trying to add five more to the list.</p><h2>1. A Body of Divinity by Thomas Watson.</h2><p>The number one slot goes to Thomas Watson&#8217;s<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Divinity-Thomas-Watson/dp/0851511449/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2PBV8H85ALVAN&amp;keywords=a+body+of+divinity+thomas+watson&amp;qid=1576075041&amp;sprefix=a+body+of+%2Caps%2C201&amp;sr=8-2"><strong>A Body of Divinity</strong></a>. <span style="color: #000000;">This is an exposition of the Westminster Assembly&#8217;s Catechism. Basically, it&#8217;s a systematic theology. Watson was a puritan preacher. And if you&#8217;ve never read any works by the puritans then this is a great place to start. Watson is one of the easiest puritans to read. That doesn&#8217;t mean that this is light reading. I kept going back and rereading sentences and paragraphs, which led me to rereading whole chapters. This will be a book that I turn to over and over again in my lifetime. </span></span></p><h2>2. Atomic Habits by James Clear</h2><p>It&#8217;s no secret that I enjoy reading, writing, and speaking about discipline. I wrote a book about <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Art-Spiritual-Disciplines-ebook/dp/B00C9GENFQ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=the+lost+art+of+spiritual+disciplines&amp;qid=1576075428&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">spiritual disciplines</a></span></strong> a few years ago. I needed some inspiration to get back into shape as 2019 came to a close, and a new year approached. I picked up <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=181TA85Z6AZVK&amp;keywords=atomic+habits+by+james+clear&amp;qid=1576075740&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=atomi%2Cstripbooks%2C191&amp;sr=1-1">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a></strong></span>. Some books just come at the right time in your life. This was one of those books. Clear uses a lot of scientific examples, and real-life experience to show how habits form us. Unlike some books on habits, Clear gives simple tools and methods for you to implement. I couldn&#8217;t put the book down, it was just what I needed. I didn&#8217;t want to start these methods in January, I started the first week of December. I picked up the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.baronfig.com/products/clear-habit-journal?variant=12894598561875&amp;subset=guided%20editions">Clear Habit Journal by Baron Fig</a></strong></span> to help track my habits and set goals. I&#8217;m intending for 2020 to be the best year for reaching my goals.</p><h2>3. 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson</h2><p>Jordan Peterson is a polarizing figure. His television interviews and classroom lectures have been a big hit on YouTube. There&#8217;s no doubt that he&#8217;s one of the most influential thinkers of our day. I don&#8217;t know what I was expecting from <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=sr_1_2?crid=31ZP7OPJ9QIDJ&amp;keywords=12+rules+for+life&amp;qid=1576075938&amp;sprefix=12+ru%2Caps%2C204&amp;sr=8-2">12 Rules for Life</a></strong></span>, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be one of my favorite books of 2019, or perhaps for a long time to come. I have to agree with Douglas Wilson&#8217;s tweet review of the book, &#8220;<em>T</em><span id="reviewTextContainer2342681725" class="readable"><span id="freeTextContainer352505906136571010"><em>his book contains pockets of silliness connected by long stretches of common grace on fire</em>.&#8221; There is some silliness in some of the scientific illustrations he uses to support his ideas. But those are few and far between. I would recommend that this book be read by many people I know. I would add some caution too. Peterson uses the Bible throughout his book, leading me to believe that he has some sort of faith in God. But he also mixes in some evolutionary and philosophical theories with it. I would say that Peterson is a secular-believer, or a philosophical-believer. Those are my terms, not his or anyone else&#8217;s that I&#8217;m aware of. </span></span></p><p>Much of what Peterson writes is common sense, but common sense has been disregarded by our culture. That&#8217;s why this book is so extraordinary. Peterson is not afraid to say what we all want to say, or perhaps we don&#8217;t know how to say. Peterson knows how to say it, and he does so with clarity and precision. I&#8217;m taking my time finishing it, because I keep rereading the chapters and taking notes. So for this book to be in my top five books of 2019 without having completed it says something of its value.</p><h2>4. The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress by John Bunyan</h2><p>If you are regular visitor to my website then you know that the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress has been written <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/08/26/journey-on-the-pilgrims-progress/">about a lot this year</a></strong></span>. I read the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilgrims-Progress-John-Bunyan/dp/1848717466/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3P74L2DI2ECJB&amp;keywords=pilgrim%27s+progress+banner+of+truth&amp;qid=1576076594&amp;sprefix=pilgrim%27s+progress+banner%2Caps%2C168&amp;sr=8-2">Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</a></strong></span> over the summer. Like Thomas Watson, Bunyan was a puritan. He was probably the most creative puritan writer, producing several works of fiction. Just because this book is fictional, it is by no means a fairy tale. Bunyan uses allegory to describe the real-life journey of the christian. The main character, Christian, wants to get rid of the burden on his back, and travels to Mt. Zion in an attempt to find relief. Along the journey he encounters many people and places that have the potential to either help or disrupt his spiritual journey. Bunyan writes like he&#8217;s experienced these people and places. And if you have been a Christian for any length of time, then you have too. That&#8217;s what makes this book so amazing. You begin to recognize some of Christian&#8217;s encounters as your own. If you haven&#8217;t read it, then I encourage you to do so. While you&#8217;re at it join me on my website as I write about the characters and places that Christian encounters.</p><h2>5. Deep Work by Cal Newport</h2><p>I have a confession. I struggle with wasting too much time on social media and the internet. It&#8217;s almost become an addiction. I decided that I&#8217;ve had enough. I have too many other good things to accomplish than to waste my life on social media. Unfortunately, I have to use social media for certain things, but I can limit my intake, and the time spent on it. Enter <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2PC9FTKEI5UGB&amp;keywords=deep+work&amp;qid=1576077254&amp;sprefix=deep+work%2Caps%2C178&amp;sr=8-2">Deep Work</a></strong></span> by Cal Newport. I read Newport&#8217;s book before I read Atomic Habits. It was the perfect set-up. Newport&#8217;s thesis is about doing work that matters, and how that work gets overlooked when we are distracted. Newport adds, &#8220;<em>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It&#8217;s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time</em>.&#8221; For me, I need to focus on what matters. As a preacher, teacher, and writer, I need to be able to focus so I can produce the type of work that impacts lives. But if I&#8217;m always distracted and unfocused, then I&#8217;m going to produce shallow work. Again, this was one of those books that came at the right season. I needed a kick in the pants to get back to doing deep work.</p><p>There you have it. The top five books of 2019.

612	2019-12-09 13:23:29	\N	\N	\N	<p>A young couple makes the eighty-mile, three-day trek from Nazareth to Bethlehem. The young lady is about to give birth to a child. This is not any child, but this child had been conceived of the Holy Ghost. She had never known a man, and yet her husband believed God that this would be no ordinary Child.</p><p>Multitudes made their way to Bethlehem to pay the Roman sanctioned tax (Lk. 2:1-3). Guests filled family and friend’s houses. Mary and Joseph looked high and low for a place to stay that clear night, but to no avail. To make matters worse, the holy child was about to be delivered.</p><p>They came to an Inn and knocked on the door. The man who owned the Inn told them there was no vacancy. His place had been filled up for quite sometime. There was nothing he could do, but point them in the direction where the animals stayed. That’s the best he could offer, it was take it or leave it but he had to room for them (Lk. 2:7).</p><p>I want you to realize that this Innkeeper looks and sounds very familiar. There are those reading this who have no room for Jesus. They would rather point Him in another direction than make room for Him. I want to encourage you to listen for someone knocking on your heart’s door. Jesus stands there desiring that you will let Him in.</p><h1><u>Wrong Time</u></h1><p>The first thing we must realize it was the wrong time.</p><p>To the Innkeeper, they were just too late. Had they gotten there earlier, or perhaps gotten there later he could have had space for Jesus.</p><p>But Paul says, “<strong>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law</strong>,” (Gal. 4:4). The eternal God stepped into time and subjected himself to nine months of living inside of a womb. <strong>The God, who had no beginning, had his first day. The Creator, who breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life, was now gasping for His first breath.</strong></p><p>The Creator that created man’s eyes was seeing for the first time. The God who had made man’s mouth was crying for the first time. The Creator who had made man’s heart now had God’s own blood flowing through His veins.</p><p><strong>But the Innkeeper didn’t have room. </strong></p><p>If Jesus had shown up when the place was empty, then He could have had room. Had Jesus shown up later, then He could have had room. People will say, “<strong>If only Jesus had come earlier in my life then I would have made room for Him.</strong>” Or they will say, “<strong>I will wait until later in life to make room for Him. Try back in a few years</strong>.” “<strong>Wait until I’m older and have nothing better to do. Then I will make room for Jesus</strong>.”</p><p>It’s always the wrong time.</p><p>Critics say we live in a different age. Jesus and His teachings are antiquated and outdated. Morality and teachings about a divine being are for simpler times. This is the wrong time for Christianity. We don’t have room for another god. We don’t have room for religion. This is an age of enlightenment and progress, why believe in an old book that was written thousands of years ago? There’s just no room for Jesus at this time. We are too smart to believe in something supernatural. Science and technology have taken over as deities. This is a time of learning, a time of doubting, a time questioning, and just not time to make room for Jesus.</p><p>Take note as well, that it wasn’t just Jesus who was left out in the cold. The Innkeeper didn’t have room for Mary and Joseph either. If the world doesn’t have room for Jesus, they also don’t have room for Christians. Jesus said that if the world hated Him, then they will hate His followers too (Jn. 15:18-27).</p><p>Jesus is the Rock of Ages, the Ancient of Days, the Beginning and the Ending. He didn’t show up at the wrong time, He is timeless. He’s always on time. Behold, today is the day of salvation (2. Cor. 6:2).</p><h1><u>Wrong Place</u></h1><p>Ancient Israel’s innkeepers were to provide certain things for their guests. <strong>The Innkeeper was to provide shelter, fire, food and water.</strong> But when Joseph and Mary arrived he offered them none of those things. There just wasn’t room for Jesus.</p><p>This was the wrong place for them. Perhaps they could try somewhere else. Many don’t have room for Jesus because He’s at the wrong place at the wrong time. They kindly point Jesus in the direction to which He can go.</p><p>They will say, <strong>“You’re at the wrong place. You’ve got the wrong person. I don’t have any need for Jesus. I don’t need saving. I’m a good person. I’m sure I’ll make it to heaven.”</strong></p><p>They point Jesus in the direction of the poor and rejected. The rich, or the affluent do not need him. Go to the ignorant and simple. Not the educated and learned. Such thinking is faulty. Everyone needs Jesus!</p><p>Many will accept particular parts of His teaching. They like the parts of loving your neighbor and not judging people. But they don’t like the parts about being the only way to God, about being born of water and spirit, and being told to take up a cross and follow Him.</p><p>Why would the King of Glory come to a small town like Bethlehem? A King should announce his arrival in the courts of a palace. A King didn’t need to come to an inn seeking shelter, warmth, food and water. But this wasn’t an ordinary King. And this King wasn’t seeking shelter, fire, food and water. This Guest would be the shelter in the storm. This guest would baptize others with the Holy Ghost and fire. This Guest would be the Bread of Life. This Guest would be the Living Water.</p><p>The Innkeeper wouldn’t expect such royalty to come this place. Why would He choose this Inn? Many missed His arrival because they expected Him to arrive like David, destroying enemies and setting up a kingdom<strong>. </strong>Instead He set up His Kingdom when He arrived and would destroy His enemies by His death.</p><h1><u>No Room</u></h1><p>“Take it or leave it” was the Innkeeper’s advice. It was either stay outside with animals or find somewhere else to stay. The only thing the Innkeeper could offer was the least. The Innkeeper wasn’t going to offer his own room. If they were going to stay anywhere on the Innkeeper’s property it’s going to be on the outside, not on the inside.</p><p><strong>Myriads of people will only offer Jesus a small place in their life, or only the leftovers.</strong> They don’t want to give up anything to house Jesus. <strong>It’s a take it or leave it mentality</strong>. They will only allow Jesus to visit every once in awhile. He is not to take up space, or rearrange anything. <strong>Jesus can show up on Sundays and the occasional holiday</strong>.</p><p><strong>They stand at the door holding the vacancy schedule looking over who and what is taking up permanent vacancy. All the slots and rooms are taken up:</strong></p><ul><li>My mind? It’s filled with enough information already.</li><li>My heart? I love everything the world offers.</li><li>My soul? I’d rather take care of my physical body than my spiritual being.</li><li>My finances? I don’t have enough as it is. I’ve got bills, entertainment, and addictions to pay for.</li><li>My time? I’ve got ball games to get my kids to, Netflix to binge, and social media to mindlessly scroll through.</li></ul><p>This was a picture of Jesus’ earthly ministry. The foxes had holes and the birds had nests, but the Son of Man had nowhere to lay His head. No comfortable or soft bed to lay his sovereign head. He had to stay with friends and families.</p><p><strong>The only place that was prepared for Jesus, and the only place that room for Him, was the Cross. Everyone was willing to give up their cross for Him. No one wanted to take up residence at Calvary. </strong></p><p>The Innkeeper wasn’t the only who would reject Jesus and point Him in another direction. The townsmen of Gadara didn’t want Jesus to stay after He had healed a man afflicted with legions of demons. The Rich Young Ruler walked away and refused to sell His possessions when he implored Jesus about eternal life. Even Jesus’ hometown rejected Him with their unbelief.</p><h1><u>Do You Have Room? </u></h1><p>Beloved, do you have room for Jesus? Are you willing to open the doors of your life and let Jesus in and take up residence? Do you have room? Or is it the wrong time? Would you rather come back at another time and seek vacancy? Or is it simply the wrong place? You have no room because you refuse to take Him in? Or perhaps you point Jesus to the smallest and least significant part of your life? You don’t mind Him being in the barn as long as He’s not in the house. Or would you rather have Jesus only show up on holidays and when He’s invited?</p><p>What a fatal refusal to turn away the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. The Innkeeper refused to give room to Jesus at the greatest time in history.</p><p><strong>And thus it was that the Lord of glory arrived on planet earth by way of a virgin’s womb and was born in a barn and laid in a manger. A manger of all places! Manure for carpeting and cobwebs for curtains. While men slept and angels sang and the Innkeeper retired to his bed and went to sleep to snore his way through the greatest of miracles that the Son of God became the Son of Man so that the sons of men might become the sons of God. </strong></p><p>The nameless Innkeeper has gone down into history. All we know about him was that he had no room for Jesus. What a sad way to be remembered-as the man who had no room for the Son of God.</p><p>What about you reader? Will you make room for the Son of God? Will you open the door as He stands at the door and knocks? Jesus Christ simply wants to make His abode in your life, and be King of your heart, soul, mind and strength.</p>	100	\N	No Room at the Inn	\N	/greyson-joralemon-dDvR7eD6pf8-unsplash-scaled.jpg
613	2019-11-26 16:00:13	\N	\N	\N	<p>Once Christian arrived at the Wicket-Gate <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/11/05/the-wicket-gate/">Goodwill</a></strong></span> instructed Christian to go to Interpreter’s house. At Interpreter’s house Christian would be taught about the Christian life, and the realities of discipleship.</p><p>Interpreter is a two-fold representation of the Holy Spirit as a teacher, and as those who teach and instruct believers. Interpreter’s house has seven rooms which all give insight to Christian life. Most of the rooms are ominous and need further clarification from Interpreter. This is the role that the Holy Spirit, and spiritual leaders play in the Christian life. The Holy Spirit and spiritual leaders interpret and guide Christians through various trials and temptations.</p><h2>Holy Spirit as Interpreter</h2><p>Receiving the Holy Spirit is part of the promise of salvation (Acts 2:38; 8:15-17; 10:44-48). While that is important, that is not the only function the Holy Spirit plays in the believer’s life. The Holy Spirit convicts of sin (Jn. 16:7-8); is a source of revelation (1 Cor. 2:10-11); empowers believers (Acts 1:8); guides to all truth (Jn. 16:13); bestows spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 12:7-11); is a seal in believers (Eph. 1:13); intercedes on behalf of believers (Rom. 8:26-27); it will quicken the mortal bodies of believers (Rom. 8:10-11); and, the Holy Spirit sanctifies believers (Gal. 5:16-25).</p><p>Likewise, Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would be a Helper who teaches believers (Jn. 14:26). The Greek word for “<em>Helper</em>” (ESV) is “<em>parakletos</em>” which was used in reference to legal counsel. The Holy Spirit provides counsel to believers, teaching and guiding them. Christians cannot merely rely upon their own knowledge and wisdom. We must place total dependance upon the Holy Spirit to teach and help. Much of the Christian life is completely foreign to new believers. The danger is for new believers to trust in their own feelings, emotions, or intellectual prowess and end up being defeated.</p><p>The Holy Spirit is a spiritual resource that believers must depend upon. Too often the Holy Spirit is neglected due to the faulty thinking that it is only needed at initial conversion.</p><h2>Spiritual Leaders as Interpreters</h2><p>I don’t know of any army that would send men and women out to battle without first equipping and preparing them. Thankfully, Jesus Christ has given the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers (Eph. 4:11). The function of these offices is for the equipping of the saints (Eph. 4:12). The five-fold ministry (as it has come to be known) is responsible for training the body of Christ so that they can in turn minister to one another. The verb “<em>equipping</em>” in Ephesians 4:12 (ESV) means to train or prepare people. Bible commentator, Grant Osborne, wrote, “<em>It is also a medical term for the setting of broken bones and thus can be understood as restoring people to their God-given task in the body of Christ</em>.”</p><p>Interpreter was preparing and warning Christian of the potentials he could face in his journey. Preachers and teachers do that every time they minister. They warn of the dangers of sin. They caution believers about their spiritual adversary (1 Pt. 5:8). And they equip believers with the whole armor of God so they can endure the onslaught of spiritual attacks, and be able to overcome them (Eph. 6:11-18).</p><h2>Application</h2><p>The Holy Spirit and the church’s ministry guide, help, teach, and equip. You need the Holy Spirit for counsel, and you need spiritual leaders to guide. You cannot have one without the other. To face various trials and temptations without the Holy Spirit is like the body being devoid of white blood cells. White blood cells combat illnesses and infections. To encounter spiritual battles without spiritual leadership is like going into war without a general. The general is on the front lines preparing the soldiers for what is to come, and how to overcome the enemy.</p><p>If you think you can be victorious in spiritual battles without either the Holy Spirit or pastors, then you will incorrectly interpret every situation, every temptation, every trial, and unnecessarily lose.</p><p>Christian walked through Interpreter’s house learning of numerous situations that he could inevitably face. This prepared Christian for a victorious Christian life. Thankfully, Christians can also rely upon the Holy Spirit and spiritual leaders for instruction for a victorious Christian life.</p>	100	\N	Interpreter&#8217;s House	\N	/cassie-boca-06jGTfErpWo-unsplash-scaled.jpg
614	2019-11-05 18:13:26	\N	\N	\N	<p>Once Christian left <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/10/29/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-mr-worldly-wiseman/">Mt. Sinai</a></span> with fresh directions from <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/10/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-evangelist/">Evangelist</a></span>, he finally arrived at the Wicket Gate. Above the gate was written: &#8220;<em>Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</em>” Christian began to knock and said a prayer:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“May I now enter here? Will He within open to sorry me, though I have been an undeserving rebel? Then shall I not fail to sin His lasting praise on high.”</em></p><p>At last there came to the gate a man named Goodwill. Goodwill asked who was at the door, where he came from, and what he wanted. At once Christian told Goodwill his name, that he came from the City of Destruction, and that he desired deliverance from the wrath to come. Goodwill opened the door, and urgently pulled Christian within the gate. The reason that Goodwill grabbed and pulled Christian through the gate was due to the fact that arrows would be shot at those seeking refuge at the Wicket Gate from a tower built by Beelzebub.</p><p>Without delay Goodwill quizzed Christian about his family, his journey, and about those he had met along the way. Goodwill was not surprised that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/08/27/christian-a-man-with-a-burden-and-a-book/">Christian’s family</a></span> didn’t come with him, or that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/18/a-journey-with-the-pilgrim-obstinate/">Obstinate</a></span> didn’t change his mind, or that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/24/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-pliable/">Pliable</a></span> went a short distance only to turnaround and go back to the City of Destruction. Goodwill commented:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Alas, poor man! Is the celestial glory of little esteem, that they consider it not worth running the hazards of a few difficulties to obtain it?”</em></p><p>Christian confessed that he wasn’t any better than the others. He subjected himself to the seducing words of Mr. Worldly Wiseman, and left the path only to find himself in a worse condition. Goodwill encouraged Christian that despite his deviation, that he would not be denied entrance (John 6:36).</p><p>Goodwill gave Christian instructions about the continued journey and its narrow path.</p><h2>The Narrow Path</h2><p>Goodwill told Christian, “<em>Look before thee; do you see this narrow way? THAT is the way that you must go. It was laid out by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and His Apostles and it is as straight as a rule can make it. This is the way you must go</em>.”</p><p>Christian asked if the path had any windings, or turnings, by which a traveler may lose his way. He had already been turned aside by Mr. Worldly Wiseman, and wanted to avoid being detoured again. Goodwill replied, “<em>Yes, there are many ways presented, and they are crooked and wide. But you may distinguish the right from the wrong, for there is only one strait and narrow.</em>”</p><p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus spoke about the gate and the narrow way:</p><blockquote><p style="text-align: center;">“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few” (Matthew 7:7–8,13-14).</p></blockquote><p>The narrow way was the path that Christian was to continue traveling. Christian was to go to Mt. Zion, and there he would have his burden removed. Though Christian desired to travel without any hindrances, the narrow path wouldn’t be without its temptations. There would be crooked and wide paths in addition to the narrow path. But Christian needed to practice discernment and stay on the straight way. For it was the way paved by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and His Apostles (Eph. 2:19-22).</p><p>Like Christian, you must stay on the path. You will be presented many other paths that may look easier, or perhaps more promising. You will meet others like Mr. Worldly Wiseman who seek to entice and seduce (Matt. 7:15-16). But you must persevere on the straight and narrow path. The crooked and broad paths are populated with a lot more people, and it may look like the better option, but those ways lead to destruction.</p><h2>The Arrows of Temptation</h2><p>We should note Mr. Bunyan’s inclusion of Beelzebub’s arrows being shot at those seeking to enter the Wicket Gate. The devil shoots many arrows at those who are about to enter the gate of salvation. I’ve seen it happen a myriad of times. Read what Charles Spurgeon says of Beelzebub’s arrows:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“In this passage, Bunyan alludes to the fact that, when souls are just upon the verge of salvation, they are usually assailed by the most violent temptations.”</em></p><p>Spurgeon lists several types of arrows that hell may shoot at a soul just as they are converted:</p><ul><li>The fiery arrow of the remembrance of our sins.</li><li>“It is too late for you to be saved.”</li><li>“You have resisted the Holy Spirit; you have stifled conscience.”</li><li>“You are not one of God’s elect, you were never chosen by God.”</li><li>“You have committed the unpardonable sin.”</li></ul><p>These types of thoughts, and many others like them, are arrows shot at many vulnerable souls. Beelzebub (the devil, satan) will do anything he can to stop a soul from being saved. I remember these same kind of thoughts when my life was being changed by the Holy Spirit. It was like I was trying to talk myself out of freedom and salvation.Thankfully there were some Goodwills in my life who snatched me from the entrance of the gate and pulled me in towards Christ.</p><p>Beloved, if you are at the Wicket Gate of salvation please hurry and come in. Jesus will not deny you entrance, and He will not cast you out.</p>	100	\N	The Wicket Gate	\N	/lomig-5pbW2lc2_wQ-unsplash.jpg
615	2019-11-01 14:48:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>In the last week Kanye West released a new album entitled <em>Jesus is King</em>. Kanye’s conversion to Christianity, and subsequent release of a gospel album, have caused no little controversy. J<em>esus is King</em> has been the number one album on iTunes. The phrase “<em>Jesus is King</em>” was the number one trending topic on Twitter for three days straight. Spotify, the music streaming service, displayed a 30 story digital sign in New York City’s Times Square that said, “<em>Jesus is King</em>.”</p><p>The website <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://factsandtrends.net/2019/10/30/kanye-wests-jesus-is-king-sparks-biblical-searches/">factsandtrends.net</a></span> released a study this week that said, “<em>Google Trends show phrases mentioned on the album like &#8216;Jesus is Lord’ and the album name itself have had dramatically increased searches since Friday. Online searchers have also been trying to find more information about specific Bible verses mentioned on ‘Jesus is King.’ Bible Gateway’s website search traffic for John 8:33 and John 8:36 (mentioned in the song ‘Selah’ increased about 10 times on the day West released Jesus is King, according to Jonathan Peterson, content manager for the Bible-reading website. According to Google Trends, the verses saw as much as a 700% increase in recent online searches</em>.”</p><p>Needless to say, the release of <em>Jesus is King</em> is a significant moment in 2019. The message of Jesus Christ does not need validation from celebrities. However, Christians should take notice that things we believe are being promoted and talked about on platforms that we might not be privileged to have ourselves. What we have been given is the opportunity to talk about the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>I am not endorsing a person, rather I am pointing to Jesus Christ. Not wanting to miss an opportunity to share the gospel, I am going to employ various song titles, and lyrics from Kanye West’s Jesus is King album.</p><h2>Jesus is King</h2><p>First, the album title: Jesus is King. This is a bold declaration in today’s cultural climate. Government is not king. Money is not king. Popularity is not king. Politics is not king. Tolerance is not king. Celebrity is not king. Sports is not king. Music is not king. Entertainment is not king. There is only one King, and that is Jesus. Jesus is not nominated or voted in as King. Jesus is King over all!</p><p>Scripture plainly declares that Jesus is King over all:</p><ul><li>The King of Israel (Jn. 1:49)</li><li>The King of the Saints (Rev. 15:3)</li><li>The King over all the earth (Zech. 14:4,5,9)</li><li>The King of Righteousness (Heb. 7:2)</li><li>The King of Peace (Heb. 7:2)</li><li>The King of Glory (Ps. 24:10)</li><li>The King of Ages (1 Tim. 1:17)</li><li>The King of Kings (Rev. 17:14; 19:16)</li></ul><p>Kanye wrote in <em>Selah</em>:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“God is King, we the soldiers. </em><br /><em>Ultrabeam out the solar, </em><br /><em>when I get to heaven’s gates, </em><br /><em>I ain’t gotta look over.”</em></p><p>He wrote in <em>God is</em>:</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>King of Kings, Lord of Lords, </em><br /><em>all the things he has in store, </em><br /><em>from the rich to the poor, </em><br /><em>all are welcome </em><br /><em>through the Door</em>”<br />(Rev. 3:20; 19:16)</p><p>Jesus is the King! Does He reign in your life? Jesus has a kingdom and in order for you to see and enter the kingdom of God you must be born again of the water and the Spirit (Jn. 3:3-8).</p><h2>Jesus is Lord</h2><blockquote><p>“So that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:10–11).</p></blockquote><p>Jesus is not just the King, He is Christ the Lord! This expression of Christ’s Lordship declares His rights over creation and humanity. References to Jesus as Lord, or to His Lordship, in the New Testament totals more than 650 times, 170 of those references are in the Gospels.</p><p>Jesus is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. All other kings and lords must submit to Jesus’ Lordship and Kingship. He will not yield His authority to another. Likewise, you must submit to Christ’s Lordship if you are going to be His servant. You must confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord (Rom. 10:9), for whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved (Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:13). Peter declared on the Day of Pentecost:</p><blockquote><p>“Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that <strong>God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified</strong>. Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, ‘Brothers, what shall we do?’ And Peter said to them, ‘<strong>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit</strong>. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself’” (Acts 2:36–39).</p></blockquote><p>Listen to what Kanye says in the song <em>On God</em>,</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“How you get so much favor on your side? </em><br /><em>Accept Him as your Lord and Savior, I replied.”</em></p><p>We all must surrender our lives to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><h2>Water</h2><p>One of my favorite tracks on Jesus is King is the song entitled “Water.”</p><p style="text-align: center;">“<em>Clean us like the rain in spring</em><br /><em>Take the chlorine out our conversation</em><br /><em>Let Your light reflect on me</em><br /><em>I promise I&#8217;m not hiding anything</em><br /><em>It&#8217;s water</em><br /><em>We are water</em><br /><em>Pure as water</em><br /><em>Like a newborn daughter</em>”</p><p>Water is a biblical theme throughout the Old and New Testaments. Water was used metaphorically in reference to salvation: “With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation” (Isa. 12:3). Jesus referred the Holy Spirit as Living Water (John 4:10-15; 7:37-39). Water is associated with baptism as a cleansing from our sins (Ez. 36:25; Zech. 13:11; Matt. 3:11,16; Acts 2:38; 22:16). Water is used in reference to Scripture (Eph. 5:26).</p><p>Washing is necessary for our salvation. The actual water that is used to baptize does not do the washing, rather it is the obedience to Christ’s commands, and His ability to cleanse us from all unrighteousness:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Peter 3:21).</p></blockquote><p>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned (Mark 16:16).</p><p>Kanye continues in <em>Water</em>:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Jesus, flow through us</em><br /><em>Jesus, heal the bruises </em><br /><em>Jesus, clean the music </em><br /><em>Jesus, please use us</em><br /><em>Jesus, please help</em><br /><em>Jesus, please heal</em><br /><em>Jesus, please forgive</em><br /><em>Jesus, please reveal</em><br /><em>Jesus, give us strength</em><br /><em>Jesus, make us well</em><br /><em>Jesus, help us live</em><br /><em>Jesus, give us wealth</em><br /><em>Jesus is our safe</em><br /><em>Jesus is our rock</em><br /><em>Jesus, give us grace</em><br /><em>Jesus, keep us safe</em>”</p><p>Jesus the King will heal, deliver, forgive, and reveal!</p><h2>Tell the Devil You’re On Strike</h2><p>One of my favorite lines on the album is found in the song Hands On:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Told the devil that I&#8217;m going on a strike</em><br /><em>Told the devil when I see him, on sight</em><br /><em>I&#8217;ve been working for you my whole life</em><br /><em>Told the devil that I&#8217;m going on a strike</em><br /><em>I&#8217;ve been working for you my whole life&#8221;</em></p><p>Here is a man whose life has changed. What makes Kanye’s turnaround so significant is the dramatic shift from the lifestyle and content he produced previously to what he’s doing now. Repentance is turning away from the old life, and facing Christ (Acts 11:21; 20:21). Repentance is a change of heart, and a change of action (Matt. 3:8). You need to switch your attitude,</p><p>If we say we do not have any sin, then we are deceiving ourselves (Rom. 3:23; 1 Jn. 1:8). However, recognizing our sinful nature and ways, and repenting, then Jesus the King will forgive us (1 Jn. 1:9).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Only if they knew what I knew, uh</em><br /><em>I was never new &#8217;til I knew of</em><br /><em>True and living God, Yeshua</em><br /><em>The true and living God</em></p><p>Many need to declare to the devil that you are on strike! Proclaim with a loud voice that you are free from sin, free from the darkness, and living in the Light of Jesus the King!</p><p>Listen to what Kanye says in Selah:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Won&#8217;t be in bondage to any man</em><br /><em>John 8:33</em><br /><em>We the descendants of Abraham</em><br /><em>Ye should be made free</em><br /><em>John 8:36</em><br /><em>To whom the son set free is free indeed</em><br /><em>He saved a wretch like me”</em></p><h2>Every Hour We Need Him</h2><p>Throughout the album Kanye reveals how much he needs Jesus the King. On the first track, <em>Every Hour</em> the gospel choir sings:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Sing every hour (Every hour, &#8217;til the power)</em><br /><em>Every minute (Every minute, of the Lord)</em><br /><em>Every second (Every second, comes)</em><br /><em>Sing each and every millisecond (Down)</em><br /><em>We need you (We need you, sing &#8217;til the power)</em><br /><em>We need you (We need you, of the Lord)</em><br /><em>We need you (Comes)</em><br /><em>Oh, we need you (Down)”</em></p><p>It is in Jesus the King that we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). Furthermore, Jesus the sustainer of all life:</p><blockquote><p>“All things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together” (Col. 1:16-17).</p></blockquote><p>What’s revealing is that here is a man who has made billions of dollars creating and producing music and even fashion. But in the song <em>Everything We Need</em>, the thick harmony sings:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)</em><br /><em>We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)</em><br /><em>We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)</em><br /><em>We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, woah)</em><br /><em>We have everything we need”</em></p><p>Since Jesus is King, He has everything we need:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:19).</p></blockquote><p>All walks of life need Jesus the King. No matter the background, ancestry, economic situation, or walk of life, we need Jesus every hour!</p><h2>Closed on Sunday</h2><p>Finally, we must decide if we will submit to Jesus Christ’s kingship.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Closed on Sunday, you&#8217;re my Chick-fil-A</em><br /><em>Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A</em><br /><em>Hold the selfies, put the &#8217;Gram away</em><br /><em>Get your family, y&#8217;all hold hands and pray</em><br /><em>When you got daughters, always keep &#8217;em safe</em><br /><em>Watch out for vipers, don&#8217;t let them indoctrinate</em><br /><em>Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A</em><br /><em>You&#8217;re my number one, with the lemonade</em><br /><em>Raise our sons, train them in the faith</em><br /><em>Through temptations, make sure they&#8217;re wide awake</em><br /><em>Follow Jesus, listen and obey</em><br /><em>No more livin&#8217; for the culture, we nobody&#8217;s slave</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>I bow down to the King upon the throne</em><br /><em>My life is His, I&#8217;m no longer my own</em><br /><em>I pray to God that He&#8217;ll strengthen my hand</em></p><p>We give Jesus the first portion of our week and life:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Everything that hath breath praise the Lord</em><br /><em>Worship Christ with the best of your portions” (God Is)</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“They say the week start on Monday</em><br /><em>But the strong start on Sunday” (Selah)</em></p><h2>Use This Gospel</h2><blockquote><p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek (Romans 1:16).</p></blockquote><p>Brothers, and sisters, we have been given the greatest message. The good news is that Jesus is King, and He has come to seek and to save the lost (Lk. 19:10). If Jesus can save a wretch like me, He can save Kanye. The same message that you are hearing today is the same message that can save you. Change is within your reach!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Use this gospel for protection</em><br /><em>It&#8217;s a hard road to Heaven</em><br /><em>We call on Your blessings</em><br /><em>In the Father, we put our faith</em><br /><em>King of the kingdom</em><br /><em>Our demons are tremblin&#8217;</em><br /><em>Holy angels defendin&#8217;</em><br /><em>In the Father, we put our faith</em></p>	100	\N	Jesus is King	\N	/Dapper1.jpg

Quasimodo a hunchback, and Esmeralda, a marginalized gypsy. Each of them had their own issues, however, found solace in Notre Dame.</p><p>Esmeralda sings in the church a song called “<em>God Help the Outcasts.</em>” Part of the song stands out when she says,</p><blockquote><p>“I don&#8217;t know if you can hear me, or if you&#8217;re even there. I don&#8217;t know if you will listen to a humble prayer.<br />They tell me I am just an outcast, I shouldn&#8217;t speak to you&#8230;Still I see your face, and wonder, were you once an outcast too”</p></blockquote><p>Esmeralda sees herself as an outcast, and she wonders if the Savior she’s praying to was an outcast too.</p><p>The word “outcast” is defined as “<em>a person who is rejected or cast out, as from home or society</em>.”</p><p>Many in the church may feel like an outcast.</p><p>They feel like:</p><ul><li>They don’t have the right pedigree or ancestry.</li><li>They have made too many mistakes.</li><li>They are inadequate to serve Jesus.</li><li>They are not popular enough.</li><li>They have been rejected by family members, and close associates, and wonder if God, and the church would do the same.</li><li>On the job or at school people always question their Christian lifestyle, or are mocked for their dedication.</li><li>They don’t feel like they register with the 30, 60, or 100 fold (Matt. 13:8-10).</li></ul><p>Whatever the case, they feel like an outcast, or perhaps they fight feelings of rejection.</p><h2>From Nazareth</h2><blockquote><p>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene (Matthew 2:23)</p></blockquote><p>Nazareth was about 55 miles north of Jerusalem, in the regions of Galilee. Nazareth was fairly small in size and was inhabited largely with Gentiles and people noted for their crude and violent ways. The term Nazarene had long been a term of contempt, used to describe any person who was rough and churlish.</p><p>In John chapter one Nathanael heard that Jesus was from Nazareth he replied with, “<em>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth</em>?” Due to its proximity to Gentile cities and its mixed population, its backwoods manners, general biblical illiteracy and lack of refinement, the people of Judea ridiculed Galilee and Nazareth. The implication is that nothing good ever comes out of Nazareth.</p><p>In Luke chapter four when Jesus read from the Scriptures in the synagogue it was in Nazareth. The Nazarenes lived up to their reputation and were filled with wrath and wanted to kick Jesus out (Luke 4:20-30). The town of outcasts even rejected Jesus!</p><p>The Old Testament prophets foretold that the Messiah would be the object of scorn and ridicule, in other words a Nazarene:</p><blockquote><p>But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and <strong>despised</strong> of the people (Psalm 22:6).</p><p>Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, To him whom man <strong>despiseth,</strong> to him whom the nation <strong>abhorreth</strong>, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall worship, Because of the Lord that is faithful, And the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee (Isaiah 49:7).</p><p>He is <strong>despised</strong> and <strong>rejected</strong> of men; A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: And we hid as it were our faces from him; He was <strong>despised,</strong> and we <strong>esteemed him not</strong> (Isaiah 53:3).</p></blockquote><p>The Hebrew words employed to describe the Messiah are revealing:</p><ul><li><strong>Despised</strong> &#8211; to be looked down on with disdain and possibly hatred.</li><li><strong>Abhorred</strong> &#8211; to find repugnant.</li><li><strong>Rejected</strong> &#8211; being abandoned or left by others.</li><li><strong>To esteem</strong> &#8211; to regard highly; think much of. In this verse the Messiah is not held in high regard.</li></ul><p>When Matthew says that Jesus would be a called a Nazarene, in essence he is declaring that Jesus would be the promised outcast. Jesus wasn’t going to be the most admired. Jesus wasn’t going to be the most popular. Jesus wasn’t going to be the most handsome (Isa. 53:2). Jesus wasn’t going to be the wealthiest. Rather, Jesus was going to be despised, abhorred, rejected, and not esteemed. We see that over and over in the Gospels:</p><ul><li>The Pharisees despised him!</li><li>The Saducees abhorred him!</li><li>Some of His own disciples rejected Him (Jn. 6:66)!</li><li>He came unto His own and His own received Him not (Jn. 1:11)!</li></ul><h2>A Cast of Outcasts</h2><p>Scripture is made up of a cast of characters that could be labeled outcasts. Despite their background, temperament, physical attributes, or failures they were considered God’s people.</p><p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Jacob was the son of Isaac, and the grandson of Abraham. He’s name means “supplanter” or “trickster” (Gen. 27:36). He had a twin brother named Esau. Of his two sons, Isaac loved Esau the most. He was a skillful hunter, able to bring home the best venison. Jacob, on the other hand, was loved by his mother (Gen. 25:27). Jacob had soft hands, and a deceptive smile. Despite being a trickster, and not being the black sheep of the family, God chose to use Jacob, and later changed his name to Israel meaning “prince with God” (Gen. 33:28).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Leah:</strong> Jacob’s deception and choices led him to work for his uncle Laban. He fell in love with Laban’s daughter Rachel (Gen. 29:10-11). Laban, another hustler in the family, tricked Jacob in to marrying Rachel’s less-attractive sister, Leah (Gen.29:22-25). Scripture describes Rachel as a brick-house, but all Scripture says about Leah, was that she had kind eyes (Gen. 29:17). Jacob had several children with Leah, many who would make up the twelve tribes of Israel. When Jacob was about to die, it was his desire to be buried with Leah, not Rachel (Gen. 49:31).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Rahab</strong>: She was a prostitute in ancient Jericho (Josh. 2:1). As such, she would have been tolerated but scorned by the people of the city. When Joshua and Israel were about to take Jericho by siege, they sent two spies in to the city. Rahab took the two spies in and protected them (Josh. 2:5-24). Her and her family survive the attack on Jericho (Josh. 6:23). She marries a man named Salmon, and together they have a son named Boaz, who married an Moabite outcast named Ruth. Rahab and Ruth two outcasts who are in the genealogy of the God of Outcasts- Jesus Christ (Matt. 1:5-17).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>David</strong>: He was the youngest son of his father, Jesse. His older brothers were more handsome and  favorably statured. While his brothers were away fighting for Israel, David was left to watch his father’s sheep in the fields alone. When the prophet Samuel was sent to Jesse’s house to anoint the second king of Israel, Jesse left David out in the fields thinking he was incapable to be Israel’s king. Samuel believed David’s brothers fit the part of king, but God thought otherwise. God wanted the outcast, the runt of the family. What he lacked in size, he made up for in spirituality (1 Sam. 16:1-13). David’s throne would be an eternal throne notwithstanding his own weaknesses and failures (2 Sam. 7:1-17).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Zacchaeus</strong>: He was a short man with a big problem. He earned a living by being a tax collector for Rome. The major issue with that occupation is that Zacchaeus was a Jew collecting taxes from his own countrymen. When he heard Jesus was coming through his town, he climbed up a tree to catch a glimpse of Israel’s King. Everybody hated Zacchaeus, but Jesus chose to go to his house for a meal that day (Luke 19:1-10).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>The Woman at the Well</strong>: This unnamed woman came to a well in Samaria at a time during the day when no one would see her. You see, she had been married five times, and the man she was living with wasn’t her husband. She was trying to avoid being around people, and yet Jesus didn’t avoid this outcast. Instead of rejecting her Jesus told her of living water that would quench the thirst she had (John 4:5-42).</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>The Leper</strong>: Leprosy was an awful disease. No one dared come in contact with someone who had been infected with leprosy. They were the ultimate outcasts in Israel. While Jesus was in one of the cities a leper fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to cleanse him. Jesus could have spoke a word and healed him from a distance. Instead Jesus reached out His hand to touch and heal him. The man who was once an outcast now attracted crowds to hear his testimony of how Jesus the Outcast had healed him (Luke 5:12-16).</p><p>Time fails me to write about the woman marred with an awful reputation who washed Jesus with her tears and hair (Luke 7:36-50). The paralytic whose friends lowered him from a roof (Matt. 9:1-8). A demoniac who lived amongst the tombs (Mk. 5:1-20). The woman whose constant bleeding was an embarrassment to her (Mk. 5:24-34). The Old and New Testaments are full of people who were labeled outcasts. <strong>Whether they were broken from sin, paralyzed with affliction, or publicly looked down upon, The God of the Outcasts healed, comforted, accepted, and loved them.</strong></p><h2>The Church of Outcasts</h2><p>You must understand, that the church is made up with outcasts and imperfect people.</p><blockquote><p>For ye see your calling, brethren, <strong>how that not many wise men</strong> after the flesh, <strong>not many mighty, not many noble,</strong> are called: But God hath chosen <strong>the foolish things</strong> of the world to confound the wise; and God hath <strong>chosen the weak things of the world</strong> to confound the things which are mighty; <strong>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen</strong>, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:26–31).</p></blockquote><p>Here is the Message Bible’s paraphrase of this section:</p><blockquote><p>Take a good look, friends, at who you were when you got called into this life. <strong>I don’t see many of “the brightest and the best” among you, not many influential, not many from high-society families. Isn’t it obvious that God deliberately chose men and women that the culture overlooks and exploits and abuses, chose these “nobodies” to expose the hollow pretensions of the “somebodies”</strong>? That makes it quite clear that none of you can get by with blowing your own horn before God. Everything that we have—right thinking and right living, a clean slate and a fresh start—comes from God by way of Jesus Christ. That’s why we have the saying, “If you’re going to blow a horn, blow a trumpet for God (1 Corinthians 1:26–31 MSG)</p></blockquote><p>God chose you just the way that you are to bring glory unto Himself. We don’t boast of our own goodness or stature. Instead we see ourselves for what we really are- outcasts serving a God who can relate to our every feeling and emotion.</p><h2>Called to be Outcasts</h2><p>Christ does not save us so we can fit in with the culture we live in. Rather, he saves us, and transforms us into His image, and then wants us to live as outcasts and vagabonds.</p><blockquote><p>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, <strong>a peculiar people</strong>; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (1 Peter 2:9)</p><p>And <strong>be not conformed to this world</strong>: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</p><p>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore <strong>come out from among them, and be ye separate</strong>, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you (2 Corinthians 6:15–17).</p></blockquote><p>Notice what Jesus said, that if He was rejected then His followers would be rejected.</p><blockquote><p>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (John 15:18–19).</p></blockquote><p>If Jesus was rejected while on this earth, and if He has been rejected by unbelievers throughout history, do not be surprised if He is still rejected. And do not be ashamed that if Christ’s followers have been rejected and scorned for 2,000 plus years, that you will also be rejected.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If the Son of God was despised and ridiculed as an outcast, why are we always striving for social acceptance and status? Take note to what Paul said in Second Corinthians, “Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; <strong>and I will receive you</strong>” (2 Cor. 6:17). As we come out and separate ourselves from the world, the Lord will receive us. The word “<strong><em>receive</em></strong>” in the Greek means “<em>to admit, or to welcome.</em>” Christians are never going to be accepted by secularized culture. But we can find acceptance in Christ Jesus.</p><p>Jesus came to save sinners and outcasts—those who are truly detestable before a holy God. However, He came to seek and to save the lost. You can see that you are welcome in the in the midst of outcasts, serving the God of the Outcasts.</p>	100	\N	The God of the Outcasts	\N	/nicholas-barbaros-YoF79VE9Sec-unsplash.jpg
617	2019-10-29 14:06:40	\N	\N	\N	<p>Once Christian made it out of the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/10/21/the-slough-of-despond/">Slough of Despond</a></span></strong>, he continued his journey towards the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/10/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-evangelist/">Wicket Gate.</a></strong></span> The news of Christian’s odyssey spread throughout the surrounding towns and cities. Mr. Worldly Wiseman, from the town of Morality, was one such man who had heard the rumors about Christian. He met Christian not far from the Slough of Despond.</p><p>Seeing Christian’s burden upon his back, Mr. Worldly Wiseman was concerned about how Christian was going to have the burden removed. Christian told him about Wicket-Gate. Mr. Wiseman asked if Christian was willing to listen to his advice. Christian said, “<em>If it be good, I will; for I stand in need of good counsel.</em>” Who could blame Christian for wanting some good advice? He had just barely survived the Slough of Despond.</p><h2>Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s Advice</h2><p>Mr. Worldly Wiseman began his counsel by asking, “<em>Who bid you go this way to be rid of thy burden</em>?” “<em>A man that appeared to me to be a very great and honorable person; his name is Evangelist</em>” said Christian.</p><p>“<em>There is not a more dangerous way than that which Evangelist told you of</em>” moaned Worldly Wiseman. He then asked Christian how he came to realize the burden on his back. Christian answered, “<em>By reading this book in my hand</em>.” With exasperation Worldly Wiseman said, “<em>I thought so; and it is happened unto thee as to other weak men, who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall into thy distractions.</em>”</p><p>Worldly Wiseman mocked the residue from the Slough of Despond on Christian’s clothes. “<em>Didn’t Evangelist warn you about Despond? The way you are traveling will be filled with wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions, dragons, darkness, and even death! But Evangelist didn’t mention those hazards either, did he?</em>”</p><p>Here was Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s advice: “<em>Go to my hometown called Morality. There will be no danger there. You’ll find safety, friendship, and contentment</em>.” Next he added, “<em>Go find Mr. Legality, a man who will easily remove the burden from your back. You’ll find ease and comfort in my hometown. Go fetch your family, and they will also enjoy the pleasures of this better destination.</em>” Mr. Worldly Wiseman pointed towards a hill in the distance, which was away from the original path that Christian was told to travel.</p><h2>Christian’s Regret</h2><p>As Christian approached the hill, his burden became heavier. Dread began to grip Christian’s heart, and he was suddenly paralyzed with fear. The hill became a mountain, ablaze with fire and smoke. It looked as if the hill was going to fall upon Christian. Thoughts of regret for listening to Mr. Worldly Wiseman filled Christian’s mind.</p><p>And with that he saw Evangelist coming towards him. Christian blushed with shame for failing to listen to Evangelist’s instructions. “<em>What are you doing here, Christian</em>?” asked Evangelist. Christian stood speechless. “<em>How is it that you that thou art so quickly turned aside? For thou art now out of the way</em>” said Evangelist.</p><p>Christian explained that he met a man who persuaded him to go another way in hopes of relieving the heavy burden. Evangelist told Christian that this hill was Mt. Sinai, and Mr. Worldly Wiseman had beguiled him. Evangelist told him that Mr. Worldly Wiseman loves the doctrine of the world, and that he goes to the town of Morality to church.</p><p>Evangelist led Christian to repent of his turning aside from the original path. Next, he pointed Christian towards the Wicket-Gate and how to get back on the correct path.</p><h2>Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s Errors</h2><p>Evangelist revealed the errors in Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s advice:</p><ul><li>He loves the world’s doctrine.</li><li>His religion is morality.</li><li>His morality keeps him from the Cross.</li><li>He wants to turn people from the Way.</li><li>He believes the Cross is repulsive.</li><li>He presents his own way as the easier way.</li></ul><p>Mr. Worldly Wiseman preached a different gospel. His gospel was void of Christ’s cross, and the necessity of carrying a cross. Mr. Worldly Wiseman believed that simply being a good person, or trying to keep the Law of the Old Testament were the keys to eternal life. In his opinion, the spiritual life should not have any problems or hazards, it should be a life of ease and comfort.</p><p>Mr. Bunyan does a very good job of using Mr. Worldly Wiseman to describe the issues that Paul faced with the Galatian church. Like Christian, the Galatians had been “<em>removed from Him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ</em>” (Gal. 1:6-7). Mr. Worldly Wiseman was preaching another gospel, and leading Christian astray. The Galatians had been bewitched to believe that they could be made perfect by the flesh, or by the keeping of the Law (Gal. 3:1-5). Mr. Worldly Wiseman believed that Mr. Legality could easily remove Christian’s burden. But the Law is unable to remove the burden of sin, for the Law cannot justify the sinner. It is only by faith in Jesus Christ that one can be justified (Gal. 3:10-13). Bunyan made reference to Mt. Sinai, much as Paul did, to describe the differences between Law and Grace (Gal. 4:21-31).</p><h2>Application</h2><p>As you journey through the Christian life you are going to meet many people who want to give you advice and counsel. There will be those who will attempt to tell you how you can find relief from the burden of sin. However, any advice that attempts to remove the Cross, or to minimize salvation by grace should be avoided. Counsel that tries to get you to leave the narrow path for the broad path should be evaded.</p><p>To echo Paul’s sentiment, “<em>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed</em>” (Galatians 1:8–9).</p>	100	\N	A Journey with the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress: Mr. Worldly Wiseman	\N	/adrian-fPDCIzEE1HU-unsplash.jpg
618	2019-10-21 15:23:21	\N	\N	\N	<p>In our<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/24/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-pliable/">last post</a> </span>we considered Christian’s encounter with Pliable. Pliable was willing to go with Christian towards the Wicket Gate until they both fell into the swampy area known as the Slough of Despond. Pliable freed himself from the muddy pit and returned to the City of Destruction leaving Christian behind to fend for himself in the swampy substance.</p><h2>The Slough of Despond</h2><p>Mr. Bunyan wrote, “<em>Now I saw in my dream, that, just as they had ended this talk, they drew near to a very miry slough that was in the midst of the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name of the slough was Despond. Here, therefore, they wallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed with the dirt; and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back, began to sink in the mire.</em>”</p><p>Going back in the story, it was <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/10/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-evangelist/">Evangelist</a></span> that told Christian to escape God’s wrath to come by going towards the Wicket Gate. Christian wanted to rid himself of his heavy burden. However, Christian and Pliable were caught off guard by the Slough of Despond.</p><p>The word “<em>slough</em>” means an area of soft, muddy ground; swamp or swamp-like region. The word “<em>despond</em>” means to be depressed by loss of hope, confidence, or courage. In other words, Christian was sinking in fear and lack of confidence.</p><p>Thankfully, there was a man named Help at the slough who assisted Christian in getting out of the miry clay. Here is what Help told Christian about the Slough of Despond:</p><blockquote><p>“This miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended. It is the descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin, doth continually run, and therefore it is called the Slough of Despond: for still, as the sinner is awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many <strong>fears,</strong> and <strong>doubts</strong>, and <strong>discouraging apprehensions</strong>, which all of them get together, and settle in this place. And this is the reason of the badness of this ground.”</p></blockquote><p>Mr. Help described The Slough of Despond as a place where the conviction of sin continually runs, and where the awakened sinner is confronted with fears, doubts, and discouraging apprehensions. As the sinner is awakened to his condition he is confronted with many emotions and thoughts. Mr. Bunyan used The Slough of Despond as a metaphor for this experience in the Christian conversion.</p><h2>Fear</h2><p>Christian had already been wrestling with fear as he was fearful of the wrath of God. Hebrews 10:31 says, “<em>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</em>” This is what Adam experienced when he disobeyed God, “<em>I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself</em>” (Genesis 3:10).</p><p>Like Adam, Christian was dealing with guilt. That sense of guilt brought about a fear of God. If you were to mix fear and guilt together you’d produce sorrow: “<em>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death</em>” (2 Cor. 7:10). This godly fear produces a sorrow that leads to repentance.</p><h2>Doubts</h2><p>As a sinner begins to have their life changed through the Spirit, doubts will arise. Doubts concerning the reality of God, and if the forgiveness of sins is even possible. I remember vividly experiencing this myself after several years of backsliding. I was helping a man pray at the altar, believing he would receive the Holy Spirit. He hadn’t been attending my church for very long, and this was the first time he had been to the altar. It wasn’t long before he began to speak with other tongues, as the Holy Spirit filled him (Acts 2:1-4). As this man was being filled with the Spirit, I was being filled with doubts. I had witnessed this miracle hundreds of times in my lifetime. This Holy Ghost occurrence even happened to me! However, it had only been a few weeks since my life had been changed from years of backsliding. As that man received the Holy Spirit, I had thoughts of “<em>This isn’t real. He has just heard others do that. He’s just doing that to get us to stop praying with him. This is all learned behavior.</em>” I had never had those types of thoughts before. From that moment I began to doubt my own salvation. I even began to doubt the existence of God! This went on for several days. I didn’t tell anyone, because I was fearful of what others may think of such ideas. I just privately wrestled with these doubts. Thankfully, after much prayer and fasting those thoughts and doubts began to dissipate. I soon realized that this experience was spiritual warfare, of which I was unaware of.</p><h2>Discouraging Apprehensions</h2><p>Along with fear, and doubts, the awakened sinner would experience “discouraging apprehensions.” Apprehension is an active state of fear, usually concerning some danger or misfortune. The awakened sinner couples his apprehensions with discouragement.</p><p>Many sinners at the beginning of their conversion also feel apprehensive. They may not like the thought of losing friends and family due to their faith (Matt. 5:11;10:22; 37-38; Lk.14:26). Or they may feel apprehensive concerning denying themselves (Matt. 16:24). Perhaps they don&#8217;t feel they have the capability to live holy and godly. Whatever the case might be, the person becomes faint-hearted and it paralyzes their faith and momentum.</p><h2>The Way of Escape</h2><p>As Christian struggled to get out of the Slough of Despond a man named Help assisted Christian out of the swamp. Help told him of the King’s attempts to have the swamp fixed and covered. Unfortunately the mire had sunk 20,000 thousand carts and myriads of other travelers, despite clear instructions. Stairs had been built to remedy the Slough of Despond. Help wondered why Christian hadn’t used them. Christian said, “<em>Fear followed me so hard, that I fled the next way and fell in.</em>”</p><p>But one wonders how Pliable got out of the bog with such ease, and Christian struggled to get out. The answer to that is Pliable didn’t have a burden upon his back, and Christian did. Pliable hadn’t been awakened to his sin, Christian, on the other hand, had been awakened to the reality of his sinful nature. Fortunately, Mr. Help was there to give Christian a hand. There are those who are familiar with the Slough of Despond. They know what it’s like to wrestle with fear, doubt, and apprehension. They point to a staircase that wasn’t seen or observed. Beloved, there are others who have traveled this way before who know how to get out of the Slough of Despond. Thank the Lord for the seasoned saints who will help the newly converted Christian find relief from fear, doubt, and apprehension.</p><p>Finally, Jesus declared to Nathanael that He was the staircase to heaven (Jn. 1:50-51). Not only is He the staircase to heaven, but He is the staircase out of the Slough of Despond (1 Cor. 10:13). Don&#8217;t turn back like Pliable, but get out of the slough and keep walking towards the Wicket Gate.</p>	100	\N	The Slough of Despond	\N	/arsalan-arianmehr-m0brfG9nMPs-unsplash.jpg
619	2019-09-27 12:41:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>Warren Wiersbe is one of the most popular Christian writers and Bible commentators. His &#8220;BE&#8221; series of short Bible commentaries on each book of the Bible has been very successful. Preachers and laymen have found this series to be of great value. David C. Cook Publishers (which purchased Victor Books who originally published the BE series) compiled the BE series into Old Testament and New Testament sets, which makes up the Bible Exposition Commentary.</p><p>I have been blessed by Warren Wiersbe&#8217;s books, and his Bible Exposition New Testament Commentary is no exception. Whether you are a pastor preparing sermons and lessons, or you are a Christian who desires to grow in your knowledge of the Bible, then you will enjoy The Bible Exposition New Testament Commentary.</p><h2>Academic Level</h2><p>Before you buy a commentary, it&#8217;s important that you know what type of academic level it is written at. Some commentaries are written with other scholars in mind. Other commentaries wade into more technical aspects of the original languages. Pastoral commentaries keep the busy pastor in mind by balancing technical interpretations with practical applications. Then there are more devotional commentaries that keep academic jargon to a minimum.</p><p>The Bible Exposition New Testament Commentary is a devotional commentary. This doesn&#8217;t mean that Mr. Wiersbe doesn&#8217;t dig into the text and give accurate interpretations. Rather, he is keeping the popular audience in mind as he comments on each passage. Practical application is found throughout the commentary, making it useful for everyday usage as a devotional. You could easily sit down with your iPad and read this commentary on your <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.logos.com/partner/natewhitley?utm_source=nate&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=promo-partner">Logos</a></strong></span> app, or pull a volume down from off the bookshelf and enjoy it with a cup of coffee. Mr. Wiersbe is very conversational and easy to read, something I find very enjoyable with all of his writings.</p><p>Warren Wiersbe writes from an evangelical conservative viewpoint. He believes in the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture, and holds to a literal interpretation.</p><h2>Layout</h2><p>If you are a preacher or teacher then you will enjoy Mr. Wiersbe&#8217;s outlines for each book of the Bible. There is some alliteration in his outlines, but not much to be distracting. His outlines are succinct and are helpful if you are preparing sermons or lesson plans.</p><p>Mr. Wiersbe&#8217;s book introductions are helpful as well. Again, he doesn&#8217;t deal with varying viewpoints of authorship or dating of the material. He is a conservative evangelical choosing the side of orthodox authorship of letters, and literal interpretation. If you are looking to delve into seeing other arguments concerning authorship of letters, or whether or not a letter should be included into the canon of Scripture I recommend you find more academic commentaries. Mr. Wiersbe intends to take you to the text, explain it, then give you the insight to apply it. Which makes this commentary so accessible to various readers.</p><p>This commentary isn&#8217;t so much a verse by verse commentary. I would consider it more of a mixture of verse by verse commentary and sectional commentary. What I mean is that each verse of a chapter may not be dealt with in particular. Instead, Mr. Wiersbe will make his comments on each verse within an exposition of a section. I would consider these more in the form of sermons or lessons. Which again is the point of a devotional commentary. Most Christians will be able to sit down and read several pages of this commentary and not feel like they are reading a Bible commentary. The layout feels more like a book, than most commentaries.</p><h2>Recommendation</h2><p>I have used this commentary for many years on Logos. It&#8217;s a commentary that I refer to time and time again. I also have the complete set of Old and New Testament in hardback on my shelf. As a pastor and teacher I like seeing how other pastors treat the text. Mr. Wiersbe, who pastored Moody Church in Chicago, knew what it was like to study and prepare sermons week in and week out. And what we have in this commentary is a master preacher and writer giving straight-forward biblical exposition.</p><p>The Bible Exposition Commentary of the New Testament is a commentary that I consistently reference. I highly recommend that you add it to your library.</p><p>You can purchase the Logos version of the The Bible Exposition Commentary of the New Testament on <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/541/the-bible-exposition-commentary-an-exposition-of-the-new-testament-containing-the-entire-be-series"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Logos .</span></strong></a></p><p>If you aren&#8217;t already a user of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.logos.com/partner/natewhitley?utm_source=nate&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=promo-partner">Logos Bible Software</a></strong></span> you can save money on a base package by following <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.logos.com/partner/natewhitley?utm_source=nate&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=promo-partner">this link</a></strong> </span>and using NATE8 at check out.</p>	100	\N	Commentary Review: The Bible Exposition New Testament Commentary by Warren Wiersbe	\N	/bible-exposition-commentary-new-testament.jpg
620	2019-09-24 11:49:32	\N	\N	\N	<p>Obstinate and Pliable followed Christian as he fled the City of Destruction. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/18/a-journey-with-the-pilgrim-obstinate/">Obstinate</a></span></strong> considered Christian a fool for believing in what his Book said. Rather than keep going towards the Wicket-Gate, Obstinate turned around and went home. Pliable, on the other hand, decided to stick with Christian and hear more about his pilgrimage.</p><p>Pliable was interested in Christian’s journey and what it entailed. He questioned Christian, “<em>Come, neighbor Christian, since there is none but us two here, tell me now further, what the things are, and how to be enjoyed, whither we are going.</em>”</p><p>Christian did not hesitate to tell Pliable about the promises of his Book. Pliable said, “<em>Tell me more about these promises</em>.” Christian told him of an endless kingdom, and everlasting life. Pliable wanted Christian to expand on the details of the endless kingdom. Christian described crowns of glory, and glistening garments to be worn. “<em>Tell me more</em>” exclaimed Pliable. Christian gleefully went on, “<em>There will be no more crying, nor sorrow; for He that is owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes</em>.”</p><p>Pliable was very interested in the things to be received in this eternal kingdom. He kept asking, and Christian kept answering. The thought of these blessings excited Pliable so much that he wanted to pick up the pace of their traversing.</p><p>Unfortunately, Christian and Pliable came upon a swampy area called the Slough of Despond. Both men fell into the swamp-like substance and began to sink. Pliable was able to get himself out of the slough. Christian, on the other hand, was bogged down with the weight of the burden on his back, and unable to help himself get out.</p><p>Once Pliable was out of the mud he became very angry with Christian. He didn’t attempt to help Christian, but instead chastised him for not warning him of this type of danger. A place like the Slough of Despond should have been mentioned before they set off on their journey. Pliable wanted all the things that Christian and his Book promised. But the Slough of Despond? That was a deal breaker.</p><p>Pliable wiped the muddy substance from off of himself, and began to go back to his home country. Christian was by himself again, this time sinking in the Slough of Despond.</p><p>Once Pliable made it back to his hometown some of his neighbors called him wise for coming back; some called him a fool for hazarding himself with Christian; others, again, mocked him for his cowardliness for fleeing the danger of the Slough of Despond. Bunyan adds, “<em>So Pliable sat sneaking among them</em>.” In other words, Pliable went back to blending in.</p><h2>Pliable People</h2><p>The word “pliable” is defined as “flexible,” “easily bent,” “easily influenced,” and “adaptable.” This accurately describes Pliable in Mr. Bunyan’s allegory.</p><p>Pliable was easily influenced. First, he was influenced to go with Obstinate in an attempt to bring Christian back to the City of Destruction. Second, Pliable was persuaded to forsake Obstinate and to go along with Christian towards the Wicket-Gate and the Celestial City. Pliable was so open-minded that his brains could fall out.</p><p>Pliable is like the young man who will do anything to fit in. Call him whatever you want, Pliable just wants to be accepted. He will change his mind on a whim. One moment he’s trying to persuade Christian to come back home, and the next moment he’s willing to go with Christian. But as soon as there is a little trouble, Pliable is heading back to the house.</p><p>Too many people are like Mr. Pliable, they are easily influenced. Some are so pliable that they can be fashioned into anything, they will adapt to any group of people they are around. They’ll say or do anything to be accepted. Sadly, there are Christians who will compromise convictions and doctrine to be acknowledged or considered popular. They will deviate from the exclusivity of the Christian message; they will bend their convictions of holiness to be accepted by the world; and they will assail doctrinal truths to be considered more tolerant. But if you get them around a different set of people, they will embrace whatever doctrines and values that that particular group holds. Paul says such people are not rooted in truth, and consequently are tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine (Eph. 4:14).</p><h2>False Converts</h2><p>Christian and Pliable have their obvious differences. But one of the main differences is the reason why the two of them were on this journey. Christian was on this pilgrimage due to the burden upon his back, and the reality of the divine words in his Book. Christian cried out, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/09/10/a-journey-with-the-pilgrims-progress-evangelist/">“What shall I do to be saved?”</a></strong></span> That’s what started this journey. In contrast, Pliable was on this pilgrimage for the blessings that Christian told him about.</p><p>Christian wanted deliverance from his sin. Pliable wanted the blessings offered from the Celestial City. That sounds familiar:</p><blockquote><p>“As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away” (Matthew 13:20–21).</p></blockquote><p>Pliable is a perfect example of the Word of God being sown on rocky ground. Pliable received the promises of Christian’s Book with joy, but he was unwilling to go further as soon as they reached the Slough of Despond.</p><p>Pliable didn’t want deliverance from his sin. No, he wanted all the blessings that he could get. Unbeknownst to Pliable, the greatest blessing he could receive would be the forgiveness of his sins, and fellowship with the King of the Celestial City.</p><h2>True Pliability</h2><p>Paul encouraged the church in Rome:</p><blockquote><p>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2).</p></blockquote><p>Christians are not to be conformed to this world. Rather, they are to be transformed. There is a difference in being conformed and being transformed. Pliable was easily conformed to the world around him. Christian was being transformed by God.</p><p>Bible Commentator, Leon Morris, writes, “<em>Christians have been introduced into the life of the world to come; what a tragedy, then, if they conform to the perishing world they have left.</em>” That perfectly describes Pliable and Christian. Pliable was conformed to a perishing world. Christian was being transformed in hopes of a new and eternal world.</p><h2>The Potter and the Clay</h2><p>Now, we are met with a conundrum. Obstinate and Pliable are as different as night and day. Obstinate is immoveable in his opinions and preferences. Pliable is easily influenced and adaptable. In our last lesson about Obstinate we realized we are to be steadfast in our faith, rooted in God’s unchanging Word. Obstinate was immoveable based upon his opinions. Now we are met with another conundrum with Pliable.</p><p>Pliable was willing to be conformed to the world around him. Christians are to be transformed by God. The prophet Jeremiah was given a wonderful illustration concerning pliability.</p><blockquote><p>“The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will let you hear my words.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was working at his wheel. And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter’s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do” (Jeremiah 18:1–4).</p></blockquote><p>Wet clay is pliable, which gives it the property of being formed into the image of the potter. Consequently, wet clay is not stable. It is unable to keep its form unless it has been heated up. Once the potter has given the malleable clay its form and shape, he “fires” it. Firing is the process of bringing clay up to a high temperature. The final aim is to heat the object to the point that the clay is mature.</p><p>in Jeremiah’s illustration, God, the Potter, has the sovereign right to make and remake the clay as He sees necessary. We as the clay are molded and shaped into the image of the Potter. Likewise, as we will see in Christian’s story, we will be placed in fires of testing so that we might mature in the faith (Jas. 1:2-4;1 Pt. 1:6-7;2 Pt. 1:3-11).</p><p>Beloved, we must be pliable so we can be transformed into the image of God. We mustn’t be like Mr. Pliable that we are conformed to the fashions of this world.</p>	100	\N	A Journey with the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress: Pliable	\N	/quino-al-zjL2nfIoq3U-unsplash.jpg
621	2019-09-18 01:34:59	\N	\N	\N	<p>We left off our story with <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/08/27/christian-a-man-with-a-burden-and-a-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evangelist</a> telling Christian to run towards the light and the Wicket-Gate. Christian began to run towards the Wicket-Gate once he heard the instructions. As Christian began to run from the City of Destruction his family cried for him to return. Christian put his fingers in his ears and ran on, crying, “<em>Life! Life! Eternal life!</em>”</p><p>His neighbors came out to see him run, and they began to mock him. Two men were committed to bringing Christian back to the City of Destruction, so they set off after him. The name of the one was Obstinate, and the name of the other was Pliable.</p><h2>Obstinate</h2><p>Christian told the two men that he was fleeing the City of Destruction, due to the fact that God was going to bring judgment. Christian invited Obstinate and Pliable to join him in forsaking the City.</p><p>Obstinate asked, “<em>And leave our friends and comforts behind us</em>?” Christian explained that he was seeking an “<em>inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, which is laid up in Heaven</em>” (Heb. 11:13-16). Obstinate became convinced that Christian was out of his mind. Obstinate didn’t want to hear such foolishness from Christian’s Book. The thought of believing in Christian’s pursuit was absurd to Obstinate. From that moment Obstinate decided to go back to the City of Destruction and continue living as he had always done. Christian wasn&#8217;t going to be able to change Obstinate&#8217;s mind.</p><p>The definition of “<em>obstinate</em>” is “<em>firmly or stubbornly adhering to one’s purpose, or opinion; not yielding to argument, persuasion, or entreaty; inflexible persistence.</em>”</p><p>That definition accurately sums up Obstinate. Obstinate accepts things as they are, resisting any change, and thinks anyone is a fool who undertakes a pilgrimage like Christian’s. He was an immovable object, stubbornly rejecting Christian&#8217;s faith.</p><blockquote><p>“A stubborn fool considers his own way the right one, but a person who listens to advice is wise’ (Prov. 12:15 God’s Word Translation).</p></blockquote><p>Obstinate didn’t want to forsake his family and comforts. He’d rather risk the chance of God’s judgment being untrue than be considered a fool for pursuing some type of heavenly place.</p><h2>Application</h2><p>First, you are going to meet many obstinate people on your Christian pilgrimage. You will have family members calling for you to return to the old life. There will be friends and neighbors who will call you foolish or brainwashed. The Bible refers to such people as “<em>stubborn</em>” (Deut. 10:16; Ps. 81:12; Acts 19:9); “<em>hard-hearted</em>” (Pro. 28:14); and “<em>stiff-necked</em>” (Ex. 32:9; Acts 7:51). People who are unyielding to God’s Word and Spirit are obstinate, and you will never change their minds with mere arguments (Col. 2:4). It will have to be the work of the Holy Spirit to change their hearts and minds (Ezk. 36:26).</p><p>Second, do not be like Obstinate. Now, this is a paradox. If we are to be steadfast in what we believe (Acts 2:42), and defend what we believe (1 Pt. 3:15-16), how are we any different than Obstinate? Here is the difference: Obstinate was stubbornly adhering to his opinions and preferences. On the other hand Christian was unyielding in his belief in God’s Word. It’s one thing to be obstinate about preferences, it’s another thing to be committed to the One who doesn’t change (Mal. 3:6)! Preferences and opinions can change, but the Word of God is forever settled in heaven (Ps. 119:89)!</p><p>Beloved, carry on! Run towards the Wicket-Gate, and leave obstinate people behind.</p>	100	\N	A Journey with the Pilgrim’s Progress: Obstinate	\N	/james-fuller-EDjIGx6kiKM-unsplash.jpg
622	2019-09-11 21:35:38	\N	\N	\N	<p>Episode 33: Seven: The Seven Deadly Sins of Ministry- Sloth</p>\r\n<p>1. The Sluggard Loves Sleep: “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man” (Proverbs 6:10–11).</p>\r\n<p>2. The Sluggard Makes Excuses: “The sluggard says, ‘There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets” (Pro. 22:13)!</p>\r\n<p>3. The Sluggard Procrastinates: “The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing” (Pro. 20:4).</p>\r\n<p>4. The Sluggard is Self-Deceived: “Lazy people consider themselves smarter than seven wise counselors” (Pro. 26:16 NLT).</p>\r\n<p>5. The Sluggard is a Destructive Force: “I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense, and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down” (Proverbs 24:30–31).</p>\r\n<p>The consequences of being a sluggard are plenteous. He will lose his job, be unemployed and broke (Pro. 6:11; 10:4; 15:19; 19:15; 20:13). The sluggard will have nothing but regrets of failures, missed opportunities, and unfulfilled ambitions (Pro. 21:25-26).</p>\r\n<p>For more information go to my website <a href="http://nswhitley.com">nswhitley.com </a></p>\r\n<p>Check out my other podcast The Bible Exposition Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bible-exposition-podcast/id1479241419?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bible-exposition-podcast/id1479241419?ign-mpt=uo%3D4</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Follow me on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/nswhitley">@nswhitley</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Like and share my Facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nswhitley/">https://www.facebook.com/nswhitley/</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Download my eBook <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Art-Spiritual-Disciplines-ebook/dp/B00C9GENFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492446690&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+lost+art+of+spiritual+disciplines">The Lost Art of Spiritual Disciplines</a></em> on Amazon</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>N.S.

623	2019-09-10 15:45:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>Christian was in a certain field reading his Book. As he read from the Book, he felt distressed and cried out, “<em>What shall I do to be saved</em>?” Christian felt like running, but he couldn’t decide which way to run. It was at this moment that a man named Evangelist walked towards him, asked, “<em>Wherefore dost thou cry</em>?”</p><p>Christian explained to Evangelist that the contents of the Book in his hand led him to feel condemned for his sin, and that God would bring destruction to his city. Christian wasn’t willing to die, even though it seemed inevitable. Evangelist asked Christian an important question, “<em>Why aren’t you willing to die, since this life is so filled with evil</em>?” If the world that Christian lived in was doomed for destruction, then why should death be avoided? Christian knew the answer, as did Evangelist. Christian said, “<em>I fear that this Burden that is upon my back, will sink me lower than the grave</em>.” Christian was convinced that there was something far worse than physical death, and that was spiritual death (Heb. 9:27). Christian’s burden would sink him below the grave to hell.</p><p>Evangelist handed Christian a parchment roll, and there was written within it, “<em>Fly from the wrath to come</em>.” Christian didn’t know where to fly off to. Then Evangelist pointed his finger over a wide field and said, “<em>Do you see yonder Wicket-Gate</em>?” Christian couldn’t see the gate. So Evangelist told Christian to focus his sight on the Light, and the Light would lead to the Wicket-Gate. Once Christian arrived at the Wicket-Gate he was to knock on the door, and it would be told him what he was to do (Matt. 7:7-8).</p><h2>The Preacher</h2><p>Evangelist represents the preacher. Christian was in need of a guide, someone who could point him in the right direction. This is the duty of every minister. Preachers are to be able to point people towards the relief they desperately need. Evangelist didn’t point Christian towards himself, rather he pointed him towards the Light and Wicket-Gate. Evangelist wasn’t the answer, but he had the answer. Christian wasn’t able to see the Wicket-Gate clearly, so Evangelist told him to look for the Light. Jesus said, “<em>I am the Light of the World. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life</em>” (Jn. 8:12). Evangelist, like John the Baptist, came to bear witness of the Light. Evangelist wasn’t the light, but came to give testimony of the Light (Jn. 1:6-8).</p><p>This story is reminiscent of Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch in Acts chapter eight. Philip sees the Ethiopian reading from the prophet Isaiah. Philip asked the man, “<em>Do you understand what you are reading</em>?” The Ethiopian answered, “<em>How can I, unless someone guides me</em>?” At that moment Philip begins to interpret the passage and told him the good news about Jesus. Together they arrived at some water and Philip baptized the man (Acts 8:26-39).</p><p>This is similar to what Evangelist did with Christian. He recognized Christian’s need, and pointed him in the right direction, which was the Wicket-Gate. The Wicket-Gate is in reference to what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few” (Matthew 7:13–14).</p></blockquote><p>Evangelist didn’t point Christian towards the easy way. Evangelist pointed him toward the narrow gate. That’s what preachers have to do. People who are hurting, and under the weight of sin need to be told where they can be saved. Christian cried out, “<em>What must I do to be saved</em>?” Christian didn’t ask what he could do to become rich. He didn’t care about material possessions, for he knew that his city was doomed for destruction. Christian wasn’t in need of the prosperity gospel. No, he needed the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Preachers, be sure you know what the Book says, and how to help sinners find the narrow gate of salvation. Physical death wouldn’t let Christian escape the judgment to come. But Evangelist pointed him towards the place where sin and death were conquered, Calvary.</p>	100	\N	A Journey With the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress: Evangelist	\N	/jonas-verstuyft-jTpPdKPGjnM-unsplash.jpg
624	2019-08-27 12:13:26	\N	\N	\N	<p>Mr. Bunyan begins his story by introducing the main character, a man named Christian. Christian is described as being clothed with rags, a burden on his back, and a book in his hand.</p><p>The story starts with Christian opening the book and reading. He wept and cried as he read from the book. Not able to contain himself, he broke out with a lamentable cry saying, “<em>What shall I do?!</em>” Christian goes home, and there we are introduced to Christian’s wife and children.</p><p>Christian tells his wife, “<em>By reason of a burden that lies upon me, I am certain that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven, we must escape and be delivered.</em>” Unfortunately, Christian’s family did not believe him. They were concerned about his well-being, but not for his soul, or for their own souls. His wife and children urged him to lay down and get some rest. When their advice didn’t seem to cure what ailed Christian, they attempted to mock and deride him for his fear of divine punishment. Despite his family’s interventions, Christian continued to be troubled by the burden, and the city’s impending doom.</p><p>On one occasion, while praying and reading in a field, again he cried out desperately, “<em>What shall I do to be saved?!</em>” He looked this way and that way, and finally seen a man by the name of Evangelist coming his way (we will cover Evangelist in our next study).</p><h2>A Burden</h2><p>Christian was weighted down with a great burden upon his back. Like Christian, all humanity is under the weight of sin (Rom. 3:23). Read what David said concerning the weight of sin:</p><blockquote><p>“Because of your anger, my whole body is sick; my health is broken because of my sins. My guilt overwhelms me— it is a burden too heavy to bear” (Psalm 38:3–4 NLT).</p></blockquote><p>Sin is a heavy burden to bear. Christian is so over burdened with sin that he buckles under the heavy weight. Christian longs to be relieved from his burden. His family’s attempts of helping were insufficient. Sin cannot be admonished, or counseled. Christian wasn’t going to be able to sleep away his sin. Christian needed divine relief.</p><p>The awareness of our sin is the first step towards repentance. David says elsewhere, “<em>For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me</em>” (Ps. 51:3). Christian had been awakened to the fact that he had been carrying a weight that he cannot rid himself of.</p><h2>A Book</h2><p>Christian is described as having a burden on his back, but he also has a book in his hand. This book is none other than the Bible. Christian feels the weight of his sin, but is also moved by what is revealed in the book. Christian tells Evangelist, “<em>Sir, I perceive, by the book in my hand, that I am condemned to die, and after that to come to judgment.</em>” The thoughts brought him to tears and to cry out, “<em>What shall I do to be saved?</em>” This is the same reaction given by the Jews on the day of Pentecost, and the Philippian jailer (Acts 2:37-38; 16:30-31). When men read or hear of their sin, and God’s judgment upon it, they want to know if there is a way of escape.</p><p>As we will see in our next lesson, Evangelist tells him what he must to do to rid himself of the burden of sin. Christian’s journey is just about to begin. I hope you will join us on this journey with the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>.</p>	100	\N	Christian: A Man with a Burden and a Book	\N	/christopher-burns-jbsw_GUK74-unsplash.jpg
625	2019-08-26 17:32:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>The<em> Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em> was written by John Bunyan in 1678. Bunyan was born in Bedforshire, England in 1628. Seventeenth century England was in the midst of a civil war during the early part of his life. The war broke out over the limits of power between King Charles and Parliament. Bunyan served as a parliamentarian soldier during the war, which aligned him with the Non-Conformists such as the Congregationalists, Baptists, and Puritans who were also at odds with the king. After the war, Bunyan soon married, but Bunyan was struggling with doubt in God. Bunyan began to read some of his wife&#8217;s spiritual books, which began an awakening in his heart. Bunyan joined a Congregationalist church, and was later baptized and ordained as a minister in 1653.</p><p>Though the war was over, and King Charles was dead, the Non-Conformists (Congregationalists, Baptists, Puritans) had enjoyed some freedom of worship under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell and the short-lived republic. Once Cromwell died, the royalists regained power. In 1660, Charles the Second became king, and the non-conformists began to see their freedom slip away.  Those who had previously participated on the parliamentarian side of the civil war were considered the king&#8217;s political enemies. Unfortunately, this meant a clamp down on churches that were not Anglican, in other words the authorized church in England. In order for you to be a preacher, then you had to be officially licensed by the Anglican church. As you can see, this would cause a problem for the non-conformists.</p><p>During this time John Bunyan&#8217;s first wife died, leaving him with four children. Bunyan moved to Bedford, remarried, and continued to preach in Congregationalist churches. The government would harass those who wouldn&#8217;t conform to the laws, meaning they could throw someone into prison for continuing to preach without a proper license. This is exactly what happened to John Bunyan. Bunyan refused to conform or to compromise his belief. While his family, and friends urged him to conform, he refused and from 1660-1676 he was imprisoned.</p><p>Bunyan began to write during those years in prison. It was while he was in prison that he dreamed of a pilgrim on a journey. This dream inspired Bunyan to write the story of the <em>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em>. Once he was released from prison the book was finished and published. It would go on to become the second most printed book, only behind the Bible.</p><p><em>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em> is an allegory of the Christian&#8217;s experience from conversion to glorification. The main character of the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress is named Christian. We follow Christian&#8217;s journey from experiencing the burden of sin, to the removal of that burden, and his onward journey to the Celestial City.</p><p>The Banner of Truth edition says this of <em>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em>,</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Above all, <em>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em> is a life story. It depicts the life which Bunyan himself lived, and at the same time, the life with which all Christian&#8217;s can substantially identify themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Christian meets people along the way like:</p><ul><li>Evangelist</li><li>Pliable</li><li>Obstinate</li><li>Sloth</li><li>Goodwill</li><li>Mr. Worldly-Wiseman</li><li>Talkative</li><li>Charity</li><li>Watchful</li><li>Atheist</li><li>Flatterer</li></ul><p>Christian goes to places like:</p><ul><li>City of Destruction</li><li>Wicket Gate</li><li>Slough of Despond</li><li>Village of Morality</li><li>Difficulty Hill</li><li>Vanity Fair</li><li>Valley of the Shadow of Death</li><li>Doubting Castle</li><li>Celestial City</li></ul><p>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress is chock-full of Scripture, and allusions to Scripture. Bunyan and other Puritan writers immersed their works in Scripture. You can barely read a sentence without sensing Scripture.</p><h2>A Journey with the Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</h2><p>I read <em>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em> over the summer (2019), and found it to be just as relevant today as it was in the 17th century. My intention is to write several devotions based upon certain characters, places, and events that take place in <em>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em>.

626	2019-08-12 02:20:19	\N	\N	\N	<p>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise (Lk. 23:43-44).</p><p>The thief on the cross is a polarizing figure. Some want to overlook his supposed last-minute faith. Others want to claim his salvation as reasoning for delaying their faith in Christ until their dying moment. What can we learn from the thief on the cross? If we are willing to look closer at this event, we will see that this man’s faith, and Christ’s salvation shine the brightest in the darkest moment in history.</p><p>This is the Gospel According to the Thief on the Cross.</p><h1>The Son of God Condemned</h1><p>The most crucial event in all of history was the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at Calvary. Old Testament prophets foretold of the Son of God’s death (Isa. 53:2-12; Dan. 9:26; Zech. 13:6). One important detail is often overlooked in the prophecy of Christ’s crucifixion, that is He was not crucified alone. Isaiah said, “and he was numbered with the transgressors” (Isa. 53:12). Two thieves hung to Jesus’ right and left, which Mark connected to Isaiah’s prophecy (Mk. 15:27-28). Unlike these two individuals, Jesus was not crucified for committing a crime.</p><p>Crucifixion was a Roman method of judgment to intimidate others from committing crimes against Roman law. Jesus wasn’t killed for doing wrong, He was killed for doing good. Jesus healed lepers of their debilitating disease. Jesus opened the eyes of the blind, and opened the ears of the deaf. He caused the lame to walk, and withered hands to open. Jesus loosed the tongue of the mute, and set free the demoniac. Perhaps His greatest miracle was bringing the dead back to life. These mighty works of God were not the reason why the Son of Man was being crucified.</p><p>The reason Jesus was being crucified was due to the fact that He claimed He could forgive sins. When Jesus told the lame man he was forgiven of his sins, the religious rulers called it blasphemy, only God could forgive sins (Mt. 9:1-6; Mk. 2:1-10; Luke 5:17-24). When they could find no witnesses to testify of Jesus committing any crimes, they falsely accused Him of blasphemy (Mk. 14:55-64). Jesus’ claims to being the Son of God who forgives sins, and who can defeat death, led to his condemnation.</p><p>The claims of Jesus to forgive sins and save others were used to taunt Jesus as He was crucified, “He saved others, himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God” (Mt. 27:42-43). The irony of the whole scene is that He was being mocked for not being able to save Himself, yet He saved others, including the thief on the cross, by not saving Himself!</p><p>Forgiveness of sins and salvation was what brought Jesus to that dreadful cross. The religious leaders thought they were ridding themselves of a man who professed His ability to forgive sins, but in reality they led Him to the very place that would bring forgiveness and salvation to the whole world. Jesus said, “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.” This he said, signifying what death he should die (John 12:32-33).</p><p>Jesus is recorded to have said seven things while He was crucified. The first of those seven statements was, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Lk. 23:34). Even while He was suffering the cruelest of deaths, He still had the desire to forgive. While others would have reviled their accusers and executioners, Jesus chose to forgive. They were ignorantly crucifying the Son of God, and ignorantly executing God’s plan to forgive humanity’s sins. What a paradox of events!</p><h1>The Thieves Condemned</h1><p>Matthew and Luke state that two malefactors were crucified with Christ. The Greek word used for malefactor in Luke 23:39 means “someone who does evil deliberately; especially someone who deserves to be punished for their acts,” or “good-for-nothing.” Mark calls them thieves, and the word he employed meant, “a rebel probably known for pillaging and looting.” Bible commentator, Warren Wiersbe, commented, “The Greek word means ‘one who uses violence to rob openly.’” The Pulpit Commentary presumes that these two men were companions of Barabbas, who was a robber, insurrection, and was a murderer (Jn. 18:40; Mk. 15:7). Barabbas and others had started an insurrection, and robbery and murder took place. If these two were apart of this, then we can suppose that Rome would not put up with such anarchy. e can conclude that these two men were deliberate criminals. Whatever their method, the judgment for their crimes was death by crucifixion. They had taken possessions that weren’t their own, and perhaps they used violence or force to take it.</p><p>There were several significant people present at Christ’s crucifixion. Mary the mother of Jesus, the apostle John, the Pharisees, the centurions, and the various onlookers. There were none who were closer than these two thieves experiencing the same awful execution as Jesus.</p><p>Matthew said that these two thieves reviled Jesus just as everyone else had done (Mt. 27:44).</p><p>Jesus was crucified about nine o’clock in the morning and stayed on the cross until three in the afternoon. From noon until three there was darkness over all of the land (Mk. 15:25, 33). But right before the darkness set, there was an exchange between the thieves and Jesus.</p><h1>The Unbelieving Thief</h1><blockquote><p>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us (Luke 23:39).</p></blockquote><p>One of the thieves continued to mock Jesus. “If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.” This thief only wanted to be saved from his current predicament. He only had temporal saving in mind. He didn’t want Jesus to forgive his sins, He just wanted Jesus to get him off of the cross.</p><p>Certainly, the pain and suffering of that moment were excruciating, and he needed relief. But his soul was in far worse condition. This is a common problem with modern people. They look at their current condition and want relief from it. They don’t take into account the condition of their soul. They would rather be saved from their disease, pain, addiction, or plight, than be saved from their sin. Sin, in their opinion, is not their problem, the cross is.</p><p>Jesus said, if we are going to follow Him, then we are to deny ourselves, and take up our cross (Lk. 9:23). Some want Jesus, they don’t want the cross. They want the benefits of Him being the Christ, but not the requirements of Him being Lord.</p><p>The unbelieving thief said, “save thyself and us.” Jesus didn’t come to save Himself. While Jesus fasted for forty days and night and was tempted of the devil in the wilderness, He didn’t turn the stones to bread; He didn’t jump off the pinnacle of the Temple only to have angels catch him; nor did He bow down to the devil in an attempt to bypass the cross (Mt. 4:1-11). Jesus wasn’t going to come down from the cross, for it was the cross that would save the world from their sins.</p><h1>The Believing Thief</h1><p>Now, something happened within the other thief who also was hanging on a cross. He previously had reviled and mocked Jesus for a moment. But something happened to him. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom&#8221; (Luke 23:40–42).</p></blockquote><p>Before we can expound upon this thief’s rebuke and request, we need to take into consideration the moment in which this moment of faith is taking place.</p><p>This takes place right as darkness is descending upon the earth. Mary and other women are weeping. The Apostle John is comforting Jesus’ mother. No other apostles or disciples are there. The religious elite are mocking and reviling Christ. The centurions are gambling at the foot of the cross. There are no miracles taking place. The lame aren’t walking and rejoicing. Blind eyes and deaf ears aren’t being open. Water isn’t being turned into wine. Fishes and loaves aren’t being multiplied. Lepers aren’t being cleansed. The multitudes who heard Jesus preach, and work miracles aren’t present. Where are the witnesses of His saving power? Where is the woman caught in adultery who had been forgiven? Where is the lame man who was forgiven? They are nowhere to be found. This isn’t a revival meeting, crusade, or testimony service.</p><p>This whole scene doesn’t depict any faith building. If anything, faith is being depleted. The disciples’ faith had been wrecked, for they trusted that Jesus was the one who was to redeem Israel (Lk. 24:21). None of them, but John, had come to observe their Lord’s death. Their faith is dashed in pieces. How could anyone believe that Jesus was the Savior, the forgiver of sins? The crowds chanted their unbelief, with cruel insults for Jesus to come down from the cross. The crowds wanted Jesus to die, not save anyone. And granted, it doesn’t look like Jesus is capable of doing anything supernatural. It looks as if death is the only task Jesus is capable of performing.</p><p>Here is the supposed King of the Jews hanging on a cross, dying the same death as two thieves. Jesus is a bloody mess. He was beaten, scourged, and a crown of thorns placed on His head. He is stripped down and humiliated. This man is suffering with the same agony as these two thieves. How can this Man save anyone, if He can’t even save Himself? This spectacle doesn’t scream faith. If anything faith is whimpering.</p><p>But the thief on the cross? He has a first-hand view of Jesus on cross. He is so close he can hear Jesus utter, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.” The thief can see the wounds on His back. He can see the crown of thorns tearing into his scalp. He can barely make out the superscription written above Christ’s head that is written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, “This is the King of the Jews.” And many want to discount this thief’s faith. In doing so they have to overlook all of the obstacles for this man to have faith in Christ.</p><h1>Fearing God</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;This thief rebuked his fellow criminal, Dost not thou fear God, seeing that thou art in the same condemnation? (Lk. 23:40)'&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Fear God? How many times had this thief’s parents taught him about fearing God? There’s a great possibility that this man was a Jew, for the Romans didn’t treat their own in this way. How many times had this man heard about the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge? Fearing God might have kept these two men from the condemnation they were experiencing. Then again, fearing God, more than fearing man, will bring condemnation from governing authorities. Jesus did not fear man, He feared God (Mt. 22:16).</p><h1>The Guilty</h1><blockquote><p>“seeing thou art in the same condemnation? We we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss&#8221; (Lk. 23:40b-41).</p></blockquote><p>The thief recognized that he and the other criminal were getting what they deserved. They deserved the punishment for their crimes. Most criminals who are being punished would say, “I’m innocent,” or “I don’t belong here.” This doesn’t sound like most criminals.</p><p>The thief has come to the realization that he is getting what he deserved. When we realize we are guilty of our sins, that’s the first step towards repentance. I don’t know what that thief seen, but whatever got his attention on Jesus, he recognized that we was guilty. Oh, if we would see our guilt as sinners. If we would see our need for more than just getting off the cross, and see the need for our hearts corrected and cleansed. I can hear the psalmist saying, “For I acknowledge my transgressions: And my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:3).</p><h1>The Innocent</h1><blockquote><p>“but this man hath done nothing amiss” (Lk. 23:41).</p></blockquote><p>Again, this thief doesn’t seem to have a theological education, or have been part of the religious elite. But he had a revelation of that Jesus, though innocent, was being condemned. Multiple times Scripture declares that Jesus was without sin:</p><ul><li>He was undefiled, and separate from sinners (Heb. 7:26)</li><li>He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21)</li><li>He is the Holy One (Mk. 1:24; Lk. 4:34)</li><li>Pilate said there was no fault in Him (Lk. 23:14,22)</li><li>Herod said He was innocent (Lk. 23:15)</li><li>The centurion will say that Jesus was innocent (Lk. 23:47)</li></ul><p>In a life that spanned three decades, Jesus never entertained a thought, never spoke a word, and never carried out an action that was polluted by sinful motives. He was the spotless Lamb of God come to take away the sins of the world.</p><p>Jesus was innocent, but He was taking the place of the guilty. There hung two men next to Him who were guilty, and Jesus was innocent. He never stole, never robbed, never mocked, never lied, never killed, and never harmed, but He was hanging on the cross for those present at Calvary who were guilty of such.</p><h1>Jesus, Lord</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom&#8221; (Lk. 23:42).</p></blockquote><p>Once he had rebuked the unbelieving thief, he addresses Jesus. We should first notice that he calls Jesus “Lord.” Lord is the Greek word “kurios” meaning “master” or “owner.” The unbelieving thief called Jesus “Christ” meaning the “anointed one.” This man calls Jesus “Lord.” To call Jesus Lord is to put yourself under Him. You recognize His authority, your role as servant.</p><p>Brothers, and sisters, if you were hanging on a cross, and likewise the man next you was hanging on a cross, I’m not sure you could see yourself as His servant. When you get a revelation of who Jesus is, you see that He is Lord of all. Again, this is great faith, not some faith to be overlooked and dismissed.</p><h1>Remember Me</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom&#8221; (Lk. 23:42).</p></blockquote><p>Remember me! What an amazing prayer.</p><ul><li>Remember me, a thief</li><li>Remember me, a murderer</li><li>Remember me, a liar</li><li>Remember me, an instigator</li><li>Remember me, an insurrectionist</li><li>Remember me, a cheater</li><li>Remember me, a criminal</li><li>Remember me, a sinner</li></ul><p>Remember me. Remember you came to save people like me. Remember you came to save and forgive sinners. Remember me. Remember your mission.</p><ul><li>Don’t remember my sins.</li><li>Don’t remember my faults.</li><li>Don’t remember my failures.</li><li>Don’t remember my mistakes.</li><li>Don’t remember my transgressions.</li><li>Don’t remember my iniquity.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The Lord remembered Noah during the flood (Gen. 8:1).</li><li>The Lord remembered Abraham (Gen. 19:29).</li><li>The Lord remembered Sarah’s promise (Gen. 21:1)</li><li>The Lord remembered Rachel’s barrenness (Gen. 30:22)</li><li>The Lord remember His covenant with Israel (Exo. 2:24).</li><li>The Lord remembered Hannah’s prayer (1 Sam. 1:19).</li><li>The Lord remembered Cornelius’ prayers (Acts 10:31).</li></ul><p>The Lord remembers His people, His covenant, and His promises. When the Bible says that “God remembered” it doesn’t mean He’s got a short memory and has forgotten. This implies God’s faithfulness and steadfastness. God never forgets, and certainly wasn’t going to forget this dying thief’s faith. You can rest assured, beloved, that God remembers you too. He’s not forgotten where you are or what you’re going through.</p><h1>When Thou Comest into Your Kingdom</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;when thou comest into thy kingdom&#8221; (Lk. 23:42).</p></blockquote><p>If we aren’t careful when it comes to reading and studying the Bible we will miss some important details. The unbelieving thief said, “If thou be the Christ.” The other thief said, “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” There’s a difference between “if” and “when.” “If” speaks of doubt. On the other hand, “when” speaks of faith!</p><p>A dying thief realized that Jesus was Lord, and He had a Kingdom. He knew this innocent man was going to be somewhere else once He died, and he wanted to be with Him. Here is a thief not fit to live on the earth, and yet He wants to be with Jesus in His Kingdom.</p><p>No theological education, no one preaching or teaching him about the after-life, and yet he knows what Paul would understand several years later, “Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6-8).</p><h1>An Answered Prayer</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise&#8221; (Lk. 23:43).</p></blockquote><p>Here, at Calvary, prayer is answered. Jesus didn’t answer then cynical requests of the religious leaders, or the mocking crowds. But He did answer the prayer of a dying sinner, “Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”</p><p>The Jewish leaders wanted Jesus dead because He claimed He could forgive sins. And here at Calvary Jesus continued to do what He claimed. What kind of people can Jesus forgive? He can forgive a woman caught in adultery, and forgive a lame man. But He can also forgive the man dying on a cross condemned for stealing. That thief went from a Roman cross to a heavenly abode.</p><h1>A Dying Man’s Faith</h1><p>Now, I want to take a closer look at this man’s faith and forgiveness. I’ve previously stated that some want to take this man right out of heaven. They would like to steal from him, just as he had stole from others. Their thoughts, though faulty, are that of course he asked for forgiveness, he was dying on a cross. But I think we’ve already seen that this thief exercised more faith than just about anybody else in Gospel accounts.</p><p>Others want to use this man as an excuse for their delay in believing in Jesus Christ. They believe they can live anyway that they want and believe and ask for forgiveness on their death bed.</p><p>But no one is promised a death bed salvation. The woman who dies in a car wreck doesn’t get a deathbed. The man who dies of an overdose doesn’t get a deathbed. The lady who dies from a brain aneurism doesn’t get a deathbed. The young man who dies from a heart attack doesn’t get a deathbed. Life is a vapor, and you are not promised tomorrow, and you are not promised a perfect ending. But you have the opportunity to believe at this moment.</p><p>Others point to this man’s salvation drawing attention that he was neither baptized, nor received the Holy Ghost. And such details are true. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t have to be baptized or receive the Holy Ghost.</p><p>You see Jesus was alive on the cross when He granted that man forgiveness and promised him paradise. Jesus wouldn’t die for another three hours (Lk. 23:44). The New Covenant/Testament cannot be inaugurated until the death of the testator.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood&#8221; (Hebrews 9:15–18).</p></blockquote><p>This man believed and was saved. But once Christ died the New Covenant had been initiated. And the New Covenant has certain requirements. Yes, faith is essential to salvation. We must believe that Jesus is the Son of God, or else we will die in our sins (Jn 8:24). Without faith it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11:6). We must have the kind of faith that this thief had. His faith overcame every obstacle to believe in Jesus for salvation. We are without excuse when it comes to believing. We don’t have any the obstacles that he had, and yet he believed.</p><p>Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins (Heb. 9:22). Jesus’ death granted us access to forgiveness. This man seen first hand the blood that would wash away the sins of the world. If we confess our sins, or acknowledge our guilt like the thief, we will be cleansed fro our unrighteousness (1 Jn. 1:9).</p><p>Once Jesus had died on the cross, they buried Him in a borrowed tomb. Paul says it like this:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<br />God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?<br />Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin&#8221; (Romans 6:1–6).</p></blockquote><p>And again Paul says:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead&#8221; (Colossians 2:11–12).</p></blockquote><p>Once we are crucified with Christ in repentance, we are buried with Him in baptism. Baptism signifies our burial with Christ, but it also signifies our cleansing from sin:</p><p>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38; cf. Acts 8:15-17; 10:44-48; 22:16).</p><p>Jesus didn’t stay in the tomb that He was buried in. Three days later He rose from the dead conquering death and sin. If the very same power that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in us, shall also quicken our mortal bodies (Rom. 8:11). Paul said “if the Spirit of Him dwells in you.” This is not to be presumed. Earlier in Romans eight he says, “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be tat the Spirit of dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His” (Rom. 8:9). We must have the Holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts if we are going to be resurrected to new life here on earth, and quickened to be in Paradise with Christ (Acts 2:38; 8:15-17; 10:44-48).</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Finally, I like to think there is some irony in this story. Here is a man condemned to die for stealing, and possibly killing. Jesus is condemned to death for claiming to forgive sins freely. A thief takes by force, or by cunning. The thief cannot steal salvation, he cannot take it by force, or by cunning. Salvation is the free gift of God. The argument goes that you cannot pay nor work for salvation (Eph. 2:5-8). Not many argue that you can steal salvation. But some want to believe they can obtain it by cunning.</p><p>Jesus gave a parable of a wedding feast in Matthew 22. Many guests were invited to the wedding. But there was a man who was at wedding without the proper wedding garment. The king had given provision for the guests to be properly attired. The king asked the man, “Friend, how cadets thou in hither not having a wedding garment” (Mt. 22:12a)? Had the man given a proper reason for not being in the proper attire, I’m sure the king would have been reasonable and given him what was needed. But instead the man was speechless (Mt. 22:12b). He was unable to offer the feeblest excuse. He had been presumptuous, thinking he come to the king’s feast on his own terms. The king had the presumptuous man thrown into outer darkness.</p><p>If you think you are going to enter the Kingdom of Heaven on your own terms, then you will be sadly mistaken. You have been given everything you need to obtain forgiveness and salvation.</p><p>Some think the thief believed because it was his last opportunity to believe. But in reality it was his only opportunity to believe. So what would keep you from believing at this opportunity?</p>	100	\N	The Gospel According to the Thief on the Cross	\N	/Might-Cross-Religious-Symbols-Paint-Smear-Blank.jpg
627	2019-07-05 20:39:10	\N	\N	\N	<p>The letter to Philemon is one the shortest books in the New Testament. Though it is only twenty-five verses in length it is teeming with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some have wondered why this short letter was included in the New Testament. There are no theological or doctrinal issues dealt with. No warnings are given in the letter either. But this overlooked letter shows how the gospel affects even personal relationships, and how real change is made ethically through the power of the gospel.</p><p>The most commonly held background story behind this letter is that Onesimus was a slave owned by Philemon of Colossae. At some point Onesimus ran away, and perhaps even stole from Philemon (v. 18). Meanwhile, Paul was imprisoned in Rome (Acts 27-28). Eventually Onesimus either found Paul in Rome, or by God’s providence ran into Paul in this Roman prison. Either way, Onesimus was converted by Paul’s preaching. Once Onesimus was converted he became a very valuable asset to Paul’s ministry. But there was one issue: Paul was made aware of Onesimus’ status with Philemon, who was also converted by Paul’s preaching (v. 19).</p><p>This sets the stage for an interesting reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus. In this letter we see an aged apostle interceding on the behalf of a former runaway slave. As we will see in this letter the gospel reconciles us to God, and it also reconciles us to each other. But we should also note that the gospel breaks down social barriers, and the vessels that God uses have various backgrounds. God can use a once religious zealot who condoned the death of Stephen. God can convert and use a former runaway slave who stole from his master. God can also use a wealthy man who may have had several servants working for him.</p><p>Forgiveness is the key word in Philemon. Though the word is not recorded its fragrance wafts throughout the letter. Just as Paul, Philemon, and Onesimus had been forgiven of their sins and former life, Philemon must forgive Onesimus.</p><p>This is the Gospel According to Philemon.</p><h1>1. Paul’s Appreciation (1:1-7)</h1><blockquote><p>“Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house” (Philemon 1–2).</p></blockquote><p>“Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Paul begins his letter like his others, by introducing himself. This is the first time that Paul begins his letter by referring to himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ. In previous letters he would identify himself as an apostle. Being that this is a personal letter to a friend, he leaves out his authoritative position, and simply identifies himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p><p>There were at least three occasions when Paul was imprisoned: in Ephesus at the conclusion of his third missionary journey (though not recorded by Luke, but it still probably took place; Acts 19:32–41); two years in Caesarea after being arrested in Jerusalem (Acts 24:27); and two years in Rome while on trial before Caesar (Acts 28:30).</p><p>Paul was imprisoned due to his Christian ministry (Col.4:3). But Paul didn’t see his imprisonment as a punishment. Rather, he viewed his captivity as a picture of his devotion to Jesus Christ. Several times Paul referred to his imprisonment not as a jail cell in Caesarea, Ephesus, or a Rome. No, Paul referred to it as his imprisonment to Jesus Christ (Eph. 3:1; 2 Tim. 3:8).</p><blockquote><p>“unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house”</p></blockquote><p>Philemon must have had a home large enough to house a church in Colossae. Paul did not start this church, rather it was Epaphras who started this church, which stemmed from the ministry in Ephesus (Col. 1:7; 4:12-13). Evidently, Apphia was Philemon’s wife, and Archippus was their son. Together they had a powerful ministry in Colossae, and news of it reached Paul in Rome.</p><p>Paul has an appeal to make with Philemon. Paul uses quite a bit of wisdom by appealing to Philemon’s emotions. First, Paul made sure to identify himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Six times in this letter Paul refers to his imprisonment (vv 1, 9, 10, 13, 22, 23). Paul is writing to a servant owner, making sure to convey to Philemon that he too knows what it’s like to be captive to someone in authority. In other letters Paul refers to himself as a servant or slave of Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 9:19). Furthermore, if Philemon is a Christian, then he too knows what it’s like to be a servant to Christ. All of us were once slaves to sin (Rom. 6:16-22; 7:14), but now we are slaves of Christ. No longer under the cruel bondage of sin, but free to be slaves of righteousness (Romans 6:17–18).</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother&#8221; (Philemon 4–7).</p></blockquote><p>Second, Paul shows pastoral wisdom before making his request of Philemon. Like any good leader, he begins by appealing to Philemon’s emotions. Paul does more than just flatter Philemon, he makes sure to give recognition to Philemon’s kingdom efforts.</p><p>• Hearing of thy love and faith towards Jesus Christ and the saints (v. 4)</p><p>• Every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus (v. 6)</p><p>• The hearts of the saints are refreshed by Philemon (v. 7)</p><p>A wise leader knows how to address people. This is a lesson many of us need to learn. Paul knows how to communicate with people. Paul doesn’t simply go right for the request of accepting Onesimus, instead he wants Philemon to see the change that has happened in his own life. Philemon has a church in his home, loves Christ and His Church, and the saints are the better for it.</p><p>This breaks down any barriers that may not be apparent. Philemon has been wronged, but Paul knows that Philemon has been good to others, and there can’t be any contradiction. Philemon can’t be merciful and temperate to believers and not be merciful and temperate with unbelievers. To do so would harm the church in Colossae, and do harm to their witness in Colossae.</p><p>This isn’t psychology, or being patronizing. This is a leader who knows the hearts of people. It’s thinking several steps ahead. If you will learn to be kind and acknowledge the work that people do, then you will be able to facilitate the necessary changes.</p><p>Additionally, how amazing it must have been for Philemon to know that Paul was praying for him (v. 4). The apostle who had influenced millions across Asia and Europe was praying for the house church in Colossae. Philemon must have felt important!</p><h1>2. Paul’s Appeal (1:8-16)</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds&#8221; (Philemon 8–10).</p></blockquote><p>Paul begins his appeal with stating that he could simply command Philemon to accept Onesimus by standing on his authority as an apostle. The King James Version doesn’t give quite the thrust of Paul’s words that other English translations use to clarify Paul’s words: &#8220;Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required&#8221; (Philemon 8 ESV). Paul’s position and authority would be sufficient to entice Philemon to do the right thing. But that’s not what Paul wanted to do. Instead he says,</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds&#8221; (Philemon 9-10).</p></blockquote><p>Paul would rather Philemon make the right decision based on love instead of coercion. Considering that it had been publicized that Philemon had displayed love to Christ and the God’s people, Paul is again wanting Philemon to display the love of God towards his fugitive servant.</p><p>I’ve seen it too many times as a pastor. I’ve witnessed people willing to forgive others, but not willing to forgive their own family members. Or they are willing to forgive and overlook the mistakes of their own family, and refuse to give grace to others. Again, Paul displays his knowledge of people. He acknowledged Philemon’s love and hospitality to others within the church. But will he forgive and accept someone who personally done him wrong?</p><p>Jesus said in the Beatitudes, “Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy” (Mt. 5:7). If you will extend mercy, then you will be given mercy. Instead of giving mercy some like giving judgment. Jesus had something to say about judgement and mercy together:</p><blockquote><p>“Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again” (Luke 6:37–38).</p></blockquote><p>Now, we’ve used this verse to support giving financially. But in context Jesus is talking about offering forgiveness. Some would rather that text be speaking about money, because it’s easier to give money than it is to give forgiveness. The principle is true whether its money or its forgiveness. If you will give it, then you will get it. In the case of Philemon and Onesimus it’s about if Philemon is willing to reconcile with all or a select few.</p><blockquote><p>“which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me&#8221; (Philemon 11).</p></blockquote><p>The name Onesimus in the Greek means “profitable.” Paul is using a little bit of humor and play on words in his appeal. Onesimus was once unprofitable for Philemon. The word “unprofitable” means “worthless” in the Greek.</p><p>We should see how worthless of a fellow Onesimus was. This letter isn’t just about Philemon needing to forgive. Onesimus wasn’t the best of servants. Philemon probably paid a lot of money for Onesimus. From what we have seen thus far in the letter Philemon had a good family, a home large enough to have church in, and he was loving and caring.</p><p>Onesimus either stole from Philemon and ran away or, his worthlessness was a high cost while in the care of Philemon. Either way, Onesimus had it good with Philemon. We’ve seen this several times in pastoral ministry. A family loves and cares for someone and they are treated shamefully in return. Or, a family’s love is taken advantage of, only to have the person they love and care for run away, or steal from them.</p><p>Jesus gave a wonderful example of this in the parable of the two sons in Luke fifteen. We call him the prodigal son because he spent all of his father’s inheritance on worldly living.</p><p>Onesimus ran away from Philemon. Sin will do that, it will cause you to run away from the very people that love you. Sin will lead you far from God. Onesimus and the prodigal son went to a far country hoping to leave another life behind. The prodigal son found himself in a pigsty, and Onesimus found himself, one way or another, under the preaching of the Apostle Paul. Isn’t it interesting that Onesimus heard the very same gospel at Philemon’s house (because he too was converted by Paul)? At one time he probably despised it, but now he loved it!</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever&#8221; (Philemon 15)</p></blockquote><p>I love that! Perhaps Onesimus needed to hear that same message from someone else. Perhaps his running away was used by God so Onesimus could have his heart opened to the gospel. Maybe Onesimus needed to see how good he had it once before.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel&#8221; (Philemon 12–13 KJV).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&#8220;I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel&#8221; (Philemon 12–13 ESV)</p></blockquote><p>Onesimus finally lived up to his name! He was useful to the Apostle Paul. That’s the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the influence of the Holy Spirit. It will not only change your heart, it will change your lifestyle. It’ll make you want to work.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need&#8221; (Ephesians 4:28).</p></blockquote><p>Onesimus doesn’t want to steal, and he doesn’t want to run away from his problems anymore. Now he wants to work for the glory of God in Christ.</p><blockquote><p>“not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord” (Philemon 16)</p></blockquote><p>Paul doesn’t want Philemon to accept him back as a servant, but now to receive him as a brother. Onesimus was not merely returning as a slave, but as a beloved brother in the faith. Onesimus was once a bondservant, but now he&#8217;s considered a brother! That&#8217;s the gospel of Jesus Christ. A sinner becomes a saint. A prosecutor becomes a preacher.</p><h1>3. Paul’s Assurance</h1><blockquote><p>&#8220;If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say&#8221; (Philemon 17–21)</p></blockquote><p>Here is the gospel exemplified: Paul is willing to take the cost of Onesimus’ wrong doing. In other words Paul is imputing Onesimus’ debt to himself. Paul isn’t wealthy, he’s a gospel preacher who makes tents on the side, and who is currently sitting in prison. Onesimus’ has a debt that needs paid. Philemon has a reputation to uphold. And Paul is willing to take the place of Onesimus.</p><p>This is exactly what Paul lays out in Romans. That Christ Jesus justified the sinner by taking their place. God’s holiness and justice needed to be upheld, but the cost of sin was too high for sinners to pay. So Jesus Christ, our mediator, took the sinner’s place so they could be justified, God’s holiness would be appeased, finally allowing the partition of sin to broken so God and man could be unified.</p><p>Brothers, and sisters, we are never more like God when we are willing to forgive. Never are we more like Christ when we pay someone else’s debt, so reconciliation can take place.</p><p>Onesimus needs forgiveness from his sins. He finds that through the preaching of the Apostle Paul. Philemon needs to forgive the person who has wronged him. He learns about that through the letter of the Apostle Paul. Paul is willing to be the intercessor, and the debt payer so reconciliation can take place.</p><p>You must see that the gospel of Jesus Christ is more than just the forgiveness of your sins. It steps into the closest of humanity’s issues with each other.</p><p>This is the gospel according to Philemon.</p>	100	\N	The Gospel According to Philemon	\N	/aaron-burden-TNlHf4m4gpI-unsplash.jpg

This is done through the preaching of God’s Word. “Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began” (2 Timothy 1:9). Also see Romans 9:24; Ephesians 1:18; 4:4; Hebrews 3:1; 2 Peter 1:10.</p><p><strong>Vocational calling:</strong> This type of calling emphasizes the call of God into a particular kind of work or situation in life, providing an opportunity to display Christian obedience for the purpose of giving God glory. “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty” (1 Corinthians 1:26–27).<strong> A calling is a God-given purpose for a certain lifestyle or vocation.</strong></p><p>Desire doesn’t always equate to calling. Many have a desire to do some specific work, but that doesn’t mean they are divinely called to do that specific work. Some have a desire to be professional basketball players, but if they are only five foot tall, then chances are they may not be called to be a professional basketball player. When God calls a man or woman, he gives them the necessary tools to complete that task. Such is the story of the prophet Jeremiah.</p><h2>Historical Setting</h2><blockquote><p>“The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month” (Jeremiah 1:1–3).</p></blockquote><p>Jeremiah’s life and ministry were during a very turbulent and tragic time in Judah’s history. He became a prophet during the reign of Josiah. Josiah was the last faithful king in Judah’s history (2 Kings 22:1-23:27). Josiah’s father, Amon, and grandfather, Manasseh, had led the people of Judah away from the Lord. Manasseh was the worst of the Judean kings. He rebuilt the high places of idol worship that Hezekiah had torn down; erected altars to Baal; built altars in the Temple; sacrificed his son in a fire; consulted with fortune-tellers and mediums; shed innocent blood; and made Judah to sin so that they did was evil in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings 21:1-16). The sins of Manasseh were so great, that in spite of Josiah’s reforms and revival, judgment was still imminent for Judah. Israel had already gone into Assyrian captivity (2 Kings 17:1-6); Josiah’s death marked the beginning of the end for Judah as well. Judah would suffer a similar fate as that of Israel- they would be taken captive into Babylon. Not only would the people of Judah be taken into captivity, but Jerusalem would be ransacked, and the Temple would be destroyed.</p><p>With all of the spiritual, and political turmoil that is taking place in Judah, God calls for a prophet.</p><h1>1. The Call</h1><blockquote><p>“Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, ‘Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations’” (Jeremiah 1:4–5).</p></blockquote><p>The ministry of the prophet goes back to Abraham, Moses, Samuel, Elijah and Elisha. When readers of the Bible come to the Prophetic books they are met with various historical settings in the Israel and Judean timelines. Jeremiah’s calling is set against a background of many prophets calling both Israel and Judah back to God:</p><ul><li>Hosea and Amos decried injustice fueled by covenantal disobedience.</li><li>Jonah reluctantly preached to Nineveh, the capital in Assyria before they were dominant, oppressing nation.</li><li>Isaiah prophesied concerning sin, judgment and the coming Messiah.</li><li>Micah ministered near the end of the eighth century rebelling Judah for their sins.</li><li>Zephaniah denounced Judah’s worship of other gods.</li><li>Nahum announced the end of Assyria’s tyranny.</li><li>Habbakuk revealed the ways of God leading to Judah’s exile to Babylon.</li><li>Obadiah witnessed the tragedy of Babylon’s invasion.</li><li>Daniel and Ezekiel ministered during the exile in Babylon.</li><li>Haggai, Malachi, and Zechariah were allowed to return to Jerusalem and prophesied during the rebuilding of the Temple.</li></ul><p>As we can see with these various prophets, whose writings and ministries are in the prophetic and historical books of Scripture, this type of ministry was not easy, and it was not done during easy times.</p><h2>A. Prophet, not a Priest</h2><p>The origin of Jeremiah’s call to a prophetic ministry is important. The opening of Jeremiah’s writings reveal that he was the son of Hilkiah, a priest (Jer. 1:1). The priesthood was reserved for those from the tribe of Levi. If you were a Levite then you would be a priest serving in the Temple. The priest worked primarily to preserve the past by protecting and maintaining the sanctuary. They protected the holy things, and offered sacrifices to keep the people holy.</p><p>The prophets, on the other hand, worked to change the present so the nation would have a sure future. The prophets were constantly reminding God’s people of their covenant with Him, and if they didn’t keep it, then judgment would come and future generations would be in peril.</p><p>Jeremiah, by progeny, was supposed to be a priest. This was his predetermined future. But God had other plans: “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations” (Jer. 1:3-4).</p><p>Now, the language here is very interesting. A son of a priest was born to be a priest. But God wanted Jeremiah, and Hilkiah, his father, to know that he was called to be a prophet.</p><p>I want to observe a few things from this information of Jeremiah and Hilkiah’s ministry.</p><p>Many parents want their children to follow in their footsteps. It’s only natural for a father to desire for his son to take over the family business. Hilkiah’s calling wasn’t Jeremiah’s calling. Often times a parent will put unneeded pressure for a child to have the same calling as themselves. Now, we don’t know for sure if Hilkiah felt like that with Jeremiah. It’s not an usual case to extrapolate such an observation.</p><p>Some callings aren’t passed down from generation to generation. It’s not that Hilkiah’s calling was inferior to Jeremiah’s calling. It was that God’s calling was superior to the familial calling of Hilkiah’s. Judah didn’t need another priest, they needed a prophet. Hilkiah’s generation needed a priest, and he fulfilled that. But Jeremiah’s generation needed a “thus saith the Word of the Lord.” Each generation, and culture need a specific calling.</p><p>Jeremiah’s calling came from the Lord. Too many getting a calling from family members. For instance, some men get a call from a mother or father to be a preacher. What happens is that a man who is called to preach by family member, or well-intentioned church member, ends up shipwrecked.</p><p>Frustration is the fruit of trying to do something you’re not called to do, but out of fear of being accepted by parents you attempt to do something you’re not called to do. Or to continue the family trade, you forsake what you are really called to do.</p><p>We must listen to the call of God for our lives. It may be that you are called to do the same thing that your parents, or grandparents did. Or, you may not be called to do the same thing. Whatever the calling, or the vocation, you should do it with all of your might (Ecc 9:10).</p><h2>B. Anointed, and Appointed</h2><p>Jeremiah was called to be a prophet. The Lord continues and says, “I sanctified you, and ordained thee a prophet to the nations.”</p><p><strong>Sanctified-</strong> the Hebrew definition for “sanctified” is to “render holy or set apart by means of religious rites,” “removed from common use.” Jeremiah was set apart to do something uncommon. That’s the call of all believers. All of us are called to be sanctified. Christians are to be different. This is more than just an outward separation in attire. Christians are to be sanctified in their business dealings; sanctified in how they treat people; and sanctified in how they handle money. Holiness should touch every part of our lives.</p><p><strong>Ordained-</strong> the Hebrew definition of “ordained” means to be “assigned a duty, responsibility, or obligation to someone.” Jeremiah was appointed to be a prophet. He was set apart (anointed, consecrated), and appointed to be a prophet. Jeremiah was obligated to fulfill his mission, but he was also anointed to fulfill his mission.</p><p>God will anoint you, and appoint you to fulfill your calling. Anointing and appointing are a powerful combination. When anointing meets appointing progress and success are bound to take place!</p><h1>2. The Counter</h1><p>Here is what usually happens when someone gets a clear vision to their God-given calling:</p><blockquote><p>“Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child” (Jeremiah 1:6).</p></blockquote><p>Like Moses, and Gideon before him, Jeremiah found a flaw in himself, and thus in God’s call. Jeremiah seen his inexperience and youth as a disqualifications for God’s call.</p><p><strong>I cannot speak</strong>: Jeremiah realized that in order to be a prophet he would have to speak publicly. Perhaps he felt inexperienced, or inadequate to be able to speak publicly. All of us may feel like we lack the skills to complete the call of God.</p><p><strong>I am a child</strong>: The Hebrew word for “child” here can refer to an infant (Ex. 2:6); a child (1 Sam. 1:22); a boy (1 Sam. 3:1); or even a young man (Gen. 22:3; 34:19). One cannot be sure of Jeremiah’s exact age, but he was certain that he was too young to be able to be a prophet.</p><p>You may feel like you lack the ability, or experience to fulfill a calling. But if God has called you, He will also equip you to accomplish His will. I think all of us have fears of inadequacy to perform a particular calling. I believe God will equip, but I also believe He provides the means for us to improve ourselves. Going to college, attending a trade school, taking online courses, working with a mentor, these are just a few ways we can improve our experience and skills. These are also useful means for you to see whether or not you are actually called to that particular work or field.</p><h1>A. The Censure</h1><blockquote><p>“But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child” (Jeremiah 1:7a).</p></blockquote><p>Don’t say that you are too young! Don’t say that you are too old! Don’t say that you are too inexperienced! God didn’t make a mistake in calling Jeremiah, and He doesn’t make a mistake when He calls us. It’s one thing to know of your own weaknesses, but it’s another when you think God has made a mistake. This is unbelief! Furthermore, it isn’t humility, it’s pride. It’s as if you are saying that you know better than God. If He has called you, then you need to have faith that He can accomplish His will despite your weaknesses, inexperience, or supposed inability.</p><p>God sees Jeremiah’s real reason for countering the call: fear (1:8). “Don’t be afraid of them!” Jeremiah’s task is daunting. He’s to call Israel (and the nations) to repentance.</p><p>Some callings aren’t going to be easy. Listen to what the Lord said of the Apostle Paul’s calling and mission: &#8220;But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake” (Acts 9:15–16).</p><p>Everyone wants an Apostle Paul ministry! They want to start churches, travel across the sea, meet new people, encounter strange new cultures. They envision a life seen on the Discovery channel. However, many don’t want the reality of Paul’s calling and mission. Listen to the reality of Paul’s calling (2 Cor. 11:22-33):</p><ul><li>Abundant labor</li><li>Countless beatings</li><li>Acquainted with death</li><li>Forty lashes (save one) at the hands of the Jews</li><li>Beaten with rods</li><li>Stoned</li><li>Shipwrecked three times</li><li>Adrift at sea</li><li>Endangered by robbers</li><li>Endangered by his own people</li><li>Endangered by the Gentiles</li><li>Endangered in the city</li><li>Endangered at sea</li><li>Endangered in the wilderness</li><li>Endangered by false teachers</li><li>Toil and hardship</li><li>Sleepless nights</li><li>Hunger and thirst (often without food)</li><li>Cold and exposed to the elements</li><li>And apart from other things, the daily pressure for all the churches</li></ul><p>Who wants that type of ministry? Jeremiah is called to be a prophet to the nations. God doesn’t tell him what else he’s going to have to endure:</p><ul><li>The people won’t listen (Jer. 7:27)</li><li>He is beaten and put in stocks (Jer. 20:1-2)</li><li>Given a death sentence (Jer. 26:11)</li><li>The king burns Jeremiah’s scroll (Jer. 36:23)</li><li>He’s placed in a prison (Jer. 37:21)</li><li>He’s left to die in the mud (Jer. 38:6)</li><li>He’s called a liar (Jer. 43:2)</li></ul><p>Can anyone fault Jeremiah for his reluctance? I know I certainly wouldn’t. But Jeremiah has assurance in God’s calling and in His provision.</p><h4>Three assurances for Jeremiah and for us:</h4><ul><li><strong>God’s Election</strong>. God doesn’t save us, or call us because we are worthy or deserving. It’s only by the grace of God that we are saved from sin, and called to bring Him glory in our service to Him. “But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me” (1 Corinthians 15:10).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>God’s Empowerment.</strong> Jeremiah was called to be a prophet before he was even conceived! God knew him, sanctified him, and ordained him. What assurance! God had a plan for Jeremiah’s life before Jeremiah had a plan.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>God’s Protection</strong>. “Don’t be afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord” (Jer. 1:8). Jeremiah could trust in God’s election, God’s empowerment, and God’s protection. God wasn’t going to send Jeremiah to the tumultuous situation without His help. Yes, people are going to mistreat Jeremiah, but God isn’t going to leave him.</li></ul><h2>B. The Contact</h2><blockquote><p>“Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth” (Jeremiah 1:9).</p></blockquote><p>Jeremiah believed he was inadequate to speak, so God touched his mouth. But it wasn’t just the touch of God on his mouth, it was the word of God in his mouth! Jeremiah received a divine touch, and a divine word. That’s what we need today!</p><p>Brothers, and sisters, we need a touch from heaven to remove the fear of inadequacy. We need a touch from heaven to extract feelings of insecurity. We need a touch from heaven to eliminate inexperience.</p><p>But we also need to be equipped with the Word of God. Jeremiah described God’s word as a fire (Jer. 5:14; 20:9; 23:9); and like a hammer (Jer. 23:29). God also assured Jeremiah that His Word would work: “Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it” (Jeremiah 1:12).</p><h1>3. The Charge</h1><p>What exactly did Jeremiah’s calling entail?</p><blockquote><p>“And I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations” (Jer. 1:6)</p><p>“See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” (Jeremiah 1:10).</p><p>“But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the Lord, to deliver you.” (Jeremiah 1:17–19).</p></blockquote><p>Jeremiah was called to be a prophet, which is an ambassador of the Lord God. He’s going to bring words of judgment and consolation for both the present and the future.</p><h3>Jeremiah’s tasks (Jer. 1:10):</h3><ul><li>Pluck up</li><li>Break down</li><li>Destroy</li><li>Overthrow</li><li>To build</li><li>To plant</li></ul><p>Four negatives (pluck up, break down, destroy, overthrow), and two positives (build, and plant). All of these words are referenced in prophecies that Jeremiah gives in his ministry (12:14–17; 16:19–21; 18:7–9; 24:6; 25:9–32; 31:28, 40; 42:10; 45:4) God’s word has the power to give life, or to bring death (Deut. 32:39). No one would be able to deliver these nations from God’s wrath, or keep them from His love.</p><p>The Expositor’s Bible says, &#8220;For Jeremiah’s ministry, the emphasis is undoubtedly on its destructive element; four verbs are used to express this, whereas two verbs indicate its constructive and restorative element. God’s appointment brings with it his commitment of authority to carry out his goals for his prophet.&#8221;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>What can we learn from Jeremiah’s calling?</p><p>First, God has a plan for your life. Before you were born God had a blueprint for your life. If God has an appointment for you, then He also has an anointing for you to accomplish your mission.</p><p>Second, God calls you in spite of your weaknesses and inexperience. God doesn’t call you necessarily because of your ability, but because of your availability.</p><p>Third, you might be fighting feelings of insecurity, or even fear. You need to have faith that God will help and protect you. If God is for us, then who can be against us (Rom. 8:31)? If the calling seems daunting, your God is bigger than any obstacle. If you are equipped with His calling, anointing, and Word, then you have everything you need to accomplish His call for your life.</p>	100	\N	Made for a Purpose	\N	/michael-heuser-tI665XBDiAA-unsplash.jpg
629	2019-06-25 02:50:25	\N	\N	\N	<p>In his online article for Huffpost, Brandan Robertson wrote, “Run to God, Not to the Bible.” Throughout his article he insists that Christians do not need the Bible to hear God’s voice. He quotes liberal theologian Peter Enns who claims, “We need to be training our children to cultivate a relationship with God, not a relationship with the Bible.” Robertson’s argument is that the Bible should be referenced, but it shouldn’t be the main place where we come to learn about God, or how to interact with him. Instead, Robertson insists that we should listen for God speaking within the culture, and the world around us. Robertson adds, “While the Bible is an important and authoritative guide for Christian faith and practice, it isn’t the foundation or center of our faith—Jesus is…Studying Scripture is valuable, but nowhere near as valuable as cultivating a day to day relationship with the God incarnate.”</p><p>Over the past five or more years an influential mega-church pastor has moved closer to the same sentiment. Recently he made a splash when he taught that the church should “unhitch” itself from the Old Testament. The pastor claims that Christians shouldn’t say, “The Bible tells me so.” Rather they should look to what Jesus said. Which begs the question, where do we have the words of Jesus recorded?</p><p>These types of sentiments about the Bible are not new. They are old hags dressed up in new dresses. It&#8217;s the use of new language to disguise dangerous views. Instead of standing on the sure foundation of Scripture they set their sails to the winds of cultural demands and fads.</p><p>Here’s the idea that these and others are trying to propagate: We do not need the Bible, nor do we need doctrine or theology, we just need Jesus.</p><p>The problem with these types of statements and ideas is that they are theological and doctrinal statements. You see, when you make claims about God, Jesus, the Bible, the church, and how we should live, then you are doing the work of a theologian. As soon as you utter the name Jesus, you are making doctrinal claims (more on that later).</p><p>It’s not that you’re not doing theology, it’s that you’re doing theology poorly. The aversion to doctrine, is a doctrine in itself. The aversion to doctrinal propositions are in fact made up of doctrinal propositions.</p><p>Now, I know this is a youth camp. I know I should be getting you worked up into a frenzy. But I’d rather do what I have felt compelled to do over the last several months, and that’s inspire you to love God more, and in order to do that you need to fall in love with the Bible and sound doctrine.</p><h1>What is Theology?</h1><p>Theology is made up of two Greek words, “theos” meaning “god” and “logia” meaning “word.” Together it is to speak about God. When you speak or talk about God then you are doing theology. Some in this room may say, “I’m just a kid, I don’t know how to do theology. I’ll leave that to preachers and pastors.” But when you speak or talk about God you are doing theology.</p><h3>When you claim:</h3><ul><li>What God is like</li><li>Who God is</li><li>What God has done</li><li>What God can do</li><li>What God loves</li><li>What God hates</li><li>How God can be known</li><li>What God demands of creation</li></ul><h3>When you ask:</h3><ul><li>Who is Jesus?</li><li>What do you know about Him?</li><li>How can you know Him more?</li><li>Can He get to know you?</li><li>How can you know that you can know Him?</li><li>What keeps you from knowing Him?</li><li>What keeps Him from knowing you?</li><li>Where do you meet Him?</li><li>How can you meet Him?</li></ul><p>This is all the work of theology and doctrine. Such questions as above are theological in nature, and they cannot be answered without knowledge from the Bible. Mr. Robertson says he wants to get to know Jesus more. The issue is that he will have to answer theological questions to do so, and the only source to those questions is Scripture.</p><h1>What is Doctrine?</h1><p>The word “doctrine”, biblically speaking means “teaching.” So when you are talking about God you are theologizing about God, based upon the teaching that you have been taught. The Bible refers to what is called “sound doctrine” (1 Tim. 1:10; 2 Tim. 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1). The word “sound” in the Greek means “healthy.” In other words, sound doctrine is to be correct, or accurate, free from infirmity or disease.</p><p>Sound doctrine is to originate from the Bible: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p><p>Why does doctrine matter? Basically, doctrine matters because we could not correctly answer the question Jesus asked, “Who do men say that I am” (Matt. 16:15).</p><h3>Christian doctrine undertakes the effort to answer to His question:</h3><ul><li>Who Jesus is (Christology/doctrine of Jesus’ humanity and deity)</li><li>Why Jesus had to suffer (doctrine of sin)</li><li>How Jesus’ death on the cross effected salvation (atonement/doctrine of substitution)</li><li>How Jesus dwells in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (pneumatology/doctrine of the Holy Spirit)</li><li>How we benefit from his life, death, and resurrection (soteriology/doctrine of salvation)</li><li>How the Holy Spirit dwells in the midst of the new creation in Christ (ecclesiology/doctrine of the church)</li><li>What happens when Jesus returns (eschatology/end time doctrine)</li></ul><p>Those are basic doctrines that have to be answered when you answer Jesus’ question, “Who do men say that I am?” To go back to my earlier point, you can’t utter the name Jesus without it touching these key doctrines.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to say who Jesus is, we also need the doctrines of:</p><ul><li>The Oneness of God (monotheism)</li><li>Creation</li><li>Humanity (anthropology)</li></ul><p>Therefore, the necessity of knowing doctrine is essential to understanding who Jesus is. Peter answered the question correctly, but it was given to him by revelation (Mt. 16:13-20). Books aren’t enough to know who He is. You need empowerment of the Holy Spirit to help and teach you (Jn. 14:26; 15:26). The greatest help that the Holy Spirit has given us is the Bible!</p><h1>Things Most Surely Believed</h1><ol><li>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</li><li>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</li><li>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</li><li>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed (Luke 1:1–4).</li></ol><p>Luke opened his gospel by declaring his reason for writing. He wanted a young Theophilus to know with certainty those things which are most surely believed among us (Lk. 1:1,4). Those things had been delivered from eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word (Lk. 1:2). Luke felt that he had perfect understanding, and wanted to write an orderly account of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ (Lk. 1:3).</p><p>Suffice it to say, there are things most surely believed among us. There is sound doctrine that needs to be known, believed, loved, and lived. And you as young people need to know it with certainty. The phrase “you may have certainty” in the Greek is defined as “security against stumbling or falling.” Kittle’s Theological Dictionary of the New Testament says, “These words all suggest &#8216;firmness&#8217; or &#8216;certainty.&#8217; The idea in Lk. 1:4 is the &#8216;reliability&#8217; of the teachings.”</p><p>My intention today is to encourage you to know with certainty the things most surely believed among us. I will be teaching this as a series in our Christian school this year, but this morning I want to encourage you to do five things:</p><ol><li>Know and Love Doctrine</li><li>Defend Doctrine</li><li>Preach Doctrine</li><li>Live Doctrine</li><li>Worship in Sound Doctrine</li></ol><h1>1. Know and Love Doctrine</h1><p>In an age where truth is perceived to be relative and subjective, you must know what you believe. Phrases such as “my truth” and “your truth” make truth subjective to opinions and emotions. “What’s true for you isn’t true for me” is another belief held by those who want their opinions to invalidate essential truth.</p><p>Paul had this to say about denying truth:</p><p>&#8220;The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved&#8221; (2 Thessalonians 2:9–10 ESV).</p><p>First, truth is a person. Jesus declared that He was the Way, the Truth, and the Life (Jn. 14:6). Jesus followed that up and said, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word” (Jn. 14:23a). If you do not love truth, then you do not love Jesus. Paul wrote that there will be a deception for those who refuse to love the truth. The phrase “refused” in the Greek means “not receive,” “not accept,” “to take in hand,” “to react favorably to, and thus consider right and proper.”</p><p>Truth has to be received, accepted, taken in hand, and considered right and proper. Paul said they not only refused it, they also refused to love it. Paul uses the Greek word “agape” to describe this type of affection for truth. This type of love is defined as “a strong, non-sexual affection and regard for a person and their good as understood by God’s moral character (“God is love” [1 Jn. 4:8]); especially characterized by a willing forfeiture of rights or privileges in another person’s behalf.”</p><p>That’s the type of love we need for doctrine and truth. We need a love that receives it and is willing to forfeit some personal rights for it. In other words, it’s submitting to truth. We submit to Christ’s lordship and kingship, and submit to the commands of His domain. But we do this out of love, and not compulsion.</p><p>However, you are just one wrong affection from losing truth. I’ve seen too many young people (and some older) forsake truth for some other affection. Whether it’s a relationship with a boy or girl, or it’s an affection for entertainment, sports, or money. You better love truth more than you love anything else that can drag you away from truth.</p><h1>2. Defend Doctrine</h1><p>Being that you are students, and you’re either currently on a college campus, or will be in the near future, and you are going to have your faith questioned. It will either be questioned by professors or peers. Unfortunately, some of you have to defend the truth to your own family members. If you are going to know and love truth, then you better be able to defend doctrine.</p><blockquote><p>“But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will” (2 Timothy 2:23–26 NKJV).</p></blockquote><ul><li>Avoid foolish and ignorant disputes. Don&#8217;t try to answer a fool in his folly (Prov. 26:4). Simply, don’t cast your pearls before swine (Mt. 7:6).</li><li>Able to teach. Peter says to be ready always to give an answer to every man that sketch you a reason of the hope that is in you (1 Pt. 3:15a). Know what you believe in your heart, but be able to communicate it clearly.</li><li>Do not be quarrelsome, but be gentle, and patient to all. When you have to answer questions, do it with gentleness. Peter also says to do this with meekness and respect (1 Pt. 3:15b).</li><li>Correcting those who are in opposition. There will always be those who are in opposition to the truth. Jesus, the apostles, and Paul all had their opposition.</li></ul><h1>3. Preach Doctrine</h1><blockquote><p>“Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry” (2 Timothy 4:2–5).</p></blockquote><p>There is a dire need for biblical preaching. The anti-doctrinal crowd doesn’t like people to get “preachy.” But they aren’t bashful about being the loudest voice in the crowd. I’m not afraid to say that we need more preachers. My only caveat is that we need bible preachers. In the day of anonymous sources and op-eds, we need apostolic young people to open up their mouths, lift up their voices, and preach “thus saith the Word of the Lord.”</p><h3>Give us preachers like:</h3><ul><li>Noah who faithfully preached for one hundred years.</li><li>Samuel who could hear the voice of God and not waste one prophetic word.</li><li>David who could slay giants, write poetic prose, and sing a new song unto the Lord.</li><li>Jeremiah who could weep over the sin of God’s people.</li><li>Ezekiel who could see visions and use prophetic imagery to call people to repentance.</li><li>John the Baptist who was a voice crying in the wilderness preparing the way of the Lord.</li><li>Peter who turned the world upside down, who everyone thought was unlearned, but whose preaching proved that he had been in the presence of Jesus.</li><li>Paul who suffered greatly, but was unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li></ul><h1>4. Live Doctrine</h1><p>Paul wrote to Titus, a young minister in Crete, “But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine” (Titus 2:1). Another translation says, “But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine” (ESV). Verses 2-9 Paul lays out how sound doctrine influences behavior.</p><ul><li>Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness (Titus 2:2).</li><li>Older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, or slaves to wine, and they are to teach the young women (Titus 2:3).</li><li>Young women are to love their husbands and children. They are to be self-controlled, pure, working in the home, kind, and submissive to their husbands (Titus 2:4-5).</li><li>Young men are to be self-controlled, a model of good works, show integrity in their teaching, dignified, having sound speech (Titus 2:6-8).</li><li>Servants are to be submissive, well-pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering (not mooches), showing good faith (Titus 2:9-10a).</li></ul><p>Paul finishes this thought with, “that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things” (Titus 2:10b). The word “adorn” in the Greek means to “make neat,” “to make attractive,” “respectable.” The literal sense is “to make more attractive by adding ornament or color.”</p><p>Correct theology and doctrine don’t do any good if they don’t affect your lifestyle. Your faith should lead to good works (James 2:14-26). Demons and devils believe correct doctrine, but they don’t obey it (James 2:19).</p><p>There is a direct, inseparable connection between sound doctrine and holy living. Sound doctrine leads to sound living (Rom. 15:4; 1 Tim. 4:16; 6:1-3; 2 Tim. 3:10). The opposite is true. Wrong doctrine leads to wrong living: “They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed” (Titus 1:16 NASB).</p><p>We need to have purity of doctrine, and purity of life. The absence of sound doctrine, and the presence of false doctrine will lead to faulty living.</p><h1>5. Worship in Sound Doctrine</h1><p>The word “orthodoxy” is a another word for “doctrine” or “belief.” The word “doxology” means “a hymn or form of words containing an ascription of praise to God.” Therefore, orthodoxy should lead to doxology.</p><p>Correct doctrine, and theology influence our life. It also supplies life to praise and worship. You can’t worship and praise what you don’t know. Empty worship is due to hollow theology.</p><h3>Empty worship relies upon:</h3><ul><li>The preferred song</li><li>The tempo of a song</li><li>The atmosphere (lights, smoke, sound)</li><li>The right band and singer</li></ul><p>Jesus spoke with a Samaritan woman who had an incorrect concept of worship. She was looking for the proper method to worship, and she only seen two options: the Samaritan method, or the Jewish method (Jn. 4:16-26).</p><p>The Samaritan style of worship was done in ignorance. The Samaritan’s worship was limited because they only read and believed the first five books of the Old Testament (Pentateuch). Their faith was characterized by enthusiastic worship, but limited understanding.</p><p>The Jews, on the other hand, read and believed all of the Old Testament. They had truth, but they didn’t have spirit. Jesus said of the Pharisee, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me’”(Mk. 7:6).</p><p>The worship offered at Mt. Gerizim was emotional and uninformed. The worship offered at Jerusalem was knowledgeable, but was empty lip-service. Jerusalem had the truth, but lacked spirit. Samaria had spirit, but lacked truth.</p><p>Jesus corrected the Samaritan woman’s concept of worship, “You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship Him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth” (Jn. 4:22-24).</p><p>Worshiping with enthusiasm isn’t enough. Truth is foundational to worship, but if it doesn’t have any heart in it, then its cold religious piety. Truth and doctrine are always at the heart of authentic worship. Every enthusiastic emotion that isn’t connected to truth is meaningless.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Everyone is a theologian. What matters is if you are a good or bad theologian. The Bible is foundational to your doctrine, your behavior, your evangelism, and to your worship. If you remove the Bible from your Christianity, then you do not have Christianity. Instead you have a social club built around a cult-of-personality.</p><p>Scripture commands us to love God with our minds (Mt. 22:37; Mk. 12:30; Lk. 10:27). Godly living proceeds from godly thinking, which includes studying doctrine and theology. God has graciously revealed Himself through the Bible. Let us take it up and read!</p>	100	\N	Things Most Surely Believed	\N	/F90DC797-27CA-411D-A295-DD91EDD2DF67.jpeg
630	2019-06-19 21:46:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>I want to give you a few options for studying the Bible. You don’t just have to read through the Bible from cover to cover to get something out of it. I’ve given you the tools to help you properly interpret Scripture, but I want to see there are several different ways we can glean from the Bible.</p><p>In our next lesson we will look at studying the Bible in a very inductive manner. I’m going to show you next week how to break down a Scripture and study it. This week I want to go over a few methods of studying the Bible.</p><h1>Scheduling Bible Study</h1><p>Successful Bible study comes from consistent reading and studying. You cannot be sporadic in Bible study to learn and grow. Creating a habit of reading your Bible and studying your Bible will produce spiritual growth. And let me say, that you will not learn all there is to know about the Bible in one sitting, or one week, or even one year. It is line upon line, line upon line, precept upon precept, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little (Isaiah 28:13).</p><p>You should schedule your Bible time and prayer time. Some will do this together. The point is to do this consistently. Jesus didn’t heal and minister twenty-four hours a day every day, there were times when He had to get alone with God (Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, 22:39-44). Jesus wasn’t so busy that He didn’t make time to be alone with God.</p><p>The best time is when you are at your best. Personally, for me, that’s in the early morning. I get much more done in the morning than any other time. “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all of His righteousness…” can be applicable here. If we put God first in our day then He will be first the rest of the day. Others are at their best at night. Jesus got alone with God in the mornings and in the evenings. After about 10:00pm I’m about worthless. Don’t try to serve God with what’s left. We are to give Him our FIRST FRUITS, not the LEFT OVERS.</p><p>Let your quiet time be like an appointment, or an important meeting or date. Prepare for it. If someone or something wants to try to take that time just remind them you have an appointment. Or reschedule it.</p><h1>1. Devotional Bible Study</h1><p>Devotional Bible study is the most basic form of study. This is where we read through certain passages of Scripture, meditate on those scriptures and learn to apply those same scriptures.</p><p>Devotional study is your time of reading the Bible and prayer. Set a time and stick to this time of devotions each day. Start with prayer, go through praise, worship, repentance and asking God to meet certain needs. Make sure you ask the Lord to speak to you through His Word that day. Ask God for direction for your life that day. Prepare your heart and mind for reading the Bible that day.</p><p>How much time should I devote to reading?</p><p>A good average day of Bible reading should be around 15-30 minutes. I would try to read a minimum of three chapters during this time of devotions. This is time devoted to reading, meditating and application.</p><p>Get a Bible reading plan. You should read through the Bible once a year, or the minimum of reading through it in two years. There are many plans available for you to decide. Pick a plan that takes you through all the Old Testament and New Testament.</p><p>There 150 Psalms and 31 Proverbs; you could read five chapters of Psalms every day and one chapter in Proverbs and read through those two books in a month’s time. Three to five chapters a day could get you through the entire Bible in a year’s time.</p><p>In this type of devotional study you will find words, phrases, people that you can use later in your more in depth Bible study.</p><h1>2. Meditate on the Word</h1><p>&#8220;But his delight is in the law of the Lord; And in his law doth he meditate day and night&#8221; (Psalm 1:2).</p><p>Meditation has been given a bad rap in our Western culture. We connect meditation with yoga, humanism and the worship of creation. But this is not what the Bible speaks of doing. Popular meditation nowadays is thought of as a way to empty our minds and go to a imaginary place. But, Biblical meditation is a filling up of our minds and hearts with godliness. Our focus is to meditate on the law of God, His Word.</p><p>Biblical meditation is where we focus our heart and mind on Jesus (Duet 6:5). Take what you have just read in your devotions, and then think about that verse, or passage. Read that passage over and over again. Write it down and take it with you that day. Memorize that verse. But before you end your time of devotion, meditate on that scripture. Then we must seek to apply it.</p><p>How does this text apply to my life? How should I apply what God is saying? What is God trying to reveal in me? How can I relate to this character? Where does my life fit in to this event I read? Write down what you’ve read. Write down the changes you need to make from what you’ve been reading. This how we apply the scriptures in a greater depth. After your time of reading, ask the Lord to speak to you concerning that passage. Ask Him to reveal where you need work in your heart and life. Ask God to give you understanding and wisdom. Knowledge is good, but wisdom is the application to that knowledge.</p><h1>3. Topical Study</h1><p>Throughout the Bible there are many topics that can be examined. I believe the Bible cannot be exhausted. Every day that you study you will find something new that will speak to your life. Studying the Bible is one of the most exciting experiences for a Christian.</p><p>Topical study is when we choose a certain topic in the Bible and systematically study it. You can choose certain words, particular phrases, biblical promises, and or commandments. Doing a topical study will take longer than devotional reading or a character study. Generally with topical study you will have to search and reference more verses and scriptures.</p><p>The topical method traces a biblical subject throughout the Old or New Testament and perhaps even both. Studying the Bible systematically this way helps you get familiar with every part of your Bible. You can’t leave one stone turned over. This will take some time and effort.</p><h2>Choosing a Topic</h2><p>You can choose whatever topic you may feel led to study. For instance, you could study the topic of baptism, or repentance. These are two very important subjects worthy of study. Also, you could begin a study on all the prayers of the New Testament. Another interesting study could be great questions of the Bible.</p><p>I enjoy studying phrases that happen to be used more than once. Several times in St. John references the “I Am” statements of Jesus. This is a great study that you can link from John’s Gospel and other references to “I Am” in the scriptures. Another phrase used several times is “in Christ” or “in Jesus.”</p><h1>4. Character Study</h1><p>One of the most enjoyable ways to study the Bible is through the study of it’s characters. A major goal of Christian living is to develop godly character. What better way to gain better character than to study the lives of the people of the Bible?</p><p>Through the lives of the great characters of the Bible we are able to see the successes and failures of men and women. God did not leave out the flaws, he gave us the ability to look into each life without leaving out any thing. And through this type of study we are able to reflect in our own lives where we must grow and change.</p><p>Biographies are exciting to read because they give us a look into reality. Unlike fiction, biographies give us a glimpse into people’s lives. When you go into a bookstore there is a whole section given to biographies. Go through the checkout line at the grocery and see magazines given to tell the stories of people. People intrigue us, we want to know their story. Just at the end of last year the best selling book was a biography of Steve Jobs. Why? People want to know how they became successful, so we can somehow imitate that success.</p><h2>Bible Characters</h2><p>The Character Study involves finding out what the Bible says about a particular characteristic of a person, with a heavy emphasis on personal application. People’s lives are complex. You can’t sum up one person’s history in one study. Each event in that life can give more details of a person’s make up. This makes character studies interesting in the Bible. Because, one event may show one side of their personality and another event may show a completely other side.</p><p>In our study of a character we learn from their mistakes and their victories. Then we learn to apply those qualities for our lives.</p><p>You cannot learn to avoid a bad characteristic or attain a good characteristic unless you study the lives of others. The greatest teacher is history; we must learn what it teaches us. If we fail to study history we are certain to make the same mistakes.</p><h2>Steps for Character Studies</h2><p>You will need:</p><p><strong>1. Study Bible.</strong> I like the ESV Study Bible, the Zondervan NIV Study Bible edited by DA Carson. The Life Application Study Bible is really good for studying Bible characters.</p><p><strong>2.Bible concordance</strong>. Young’s Concordance or Strong’s Concordance are good places to start. These are available online for free, and on Bible apps.</p><p><strong>3.Bible dictionary.</strong> There are a myriad of Bible dictionaries available, especially online and on Bible apps. Olive Tree Bible App, YouVersion Bible App, WORDSearch App, and Logos Bible Software are all excellent resources for Bible study.</p><p>These will help you gather all the scriptures about your character. There can be other references about this person other than one book of the Bible. Paul is introduced in the book of Acts, yet his life is described more in detail by his own words in the epistles he wrote. David is mentioned in 1 Samuel-2Chronicles, but is also found in the Psalms and New Testament.</p><p>Only work on one character at a time. Take your time on a person but don’t try to exhaust your study. You will find a person’s life is complex, and as you grow in Christ that character you study will help you grow even more. How you view someone in your study can change over the years, so don’t try to exhaust your study.</p><p>1.Pick a character (David, Paul, Moses, Ruth, Jesus).</p><p>2.Do a background sketch. Where are they from? Parents? Brothers and sisters?</p><p>3.What’s their name mean? -There’s much to be written on the meaning of a name. For instance Judah means praise, Nathan means gift from God, Jacob means trickster. This is a very cool study!</p><p>4.Write down interesting facts as you study.</p><p>5. Look for qualities that can be positive. Look for negatives that you must avoid.</p><p>6. Memorize a Bible verse about them- This will help you remember a certain characteristic about that person. (Genesis 5:24 And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.)</p><h2>Application</h2><p>Remember, studying the Bible is about applying it to our life. After this study you must apply what you have learned and apply it to your life.</p><p>How did the person please God?</p><p>How did the person fail God?</p><p>What were the positive characteristics to that person’s life?</p><p>What were the negatives?</p><p>What can I learn from his or her’s life?</p><p>How can I become more like them?</p><p>How can I become less like them?</p><p>The Bible is more than just verses and chapters. It’s stories, it’s people, it’s relationships, it’s history and it’s doctrine. All Scripture is profitable! There are many ways we can read and study the Bible. These three are just a few examples among many. There is no way that the Bible is boring, it’s our approach and our attitude.</p><h1>5. Inductive Bible Study</h1><p>There have been several books written on Inductive Bible Study. Kay Arthur’s Discover the Bible for Yourself, and How to Study the Bible. Howard Hendricks’ Living by the Book. Grasping God’s Word by Scott Duvall and Daniel Hayes. Robert Traina’s Inductive Bible Study is more advanced but very helpful.</p><p>Professor Louis Agassiz and His Amazing Fish</p><p>Louis Agassiz, the renowned nineteenth-century naturalist and zoologist and professor at Harvard, was once asked, “What was your greatest contribution, scientifically?” His answer: “I have taught men and women to observe.”</p><p>Professor Agassiz used a fascinating process to do that. He would place a fish on a dissecting tray, stick it beneath the nose of a freshman, and command, “Observe this specimen and write down everything you see.”</p><p>The student would start out enthusiastically, writing down twenty or thirty things. Meanshile, the professor would disappear until the next day, when upon returning he would ask, “How are you doing?”</p><p>“Oh I saw thirty-seven things,” the student would boast.</p><p>“Wonderful!” the master would cry. “Continue to observe.”</p><p>The student would think, Man, I’ve seen everything there is to see on that fish! But since the professor told him to keep at it, he’d go back and look some more.</p><p>This process would continue for two weeks! Nothing but looking at that fish. You see, the genius of the professor, was his awareness that the basis of scientific inquiry is the process of observing.</p><h2>Observations</h2><p>Observation in Bible study means reading the text over and over again. Repeated readings will benefit your time in study. Don’t rush through this part of studying. If you can’t understand it, read it again.</p><p>G. Campbell Morgan who pastored the Westminster Chapel in London would read through a Bible book more than fifty times before preaching through it. He wanted to see as much as he possibly could before he would attempt to preach it.</p><p>Observe people, names, places, phrases. Phrases such as born again, kingdom of God, born of water, born of spirit appear in John 3:3-5 would be great place to start.</p><p>Ask questions such as: who, what, where, when, why, how. These are great questions to begin with. Often times we want to jump right into the hard stuff. However, if you take your time by answering the easier questions you can answer the tougher questions. And we can get correct context by answering the easier questions.</p><p>Now begin to make an interpretation and application. Studying John chapter three is a great place to do this type of inductive study. Asking questions about being born again, and about entering the kingdom of heaven is important information that need to get right. Interpreting and applying what you&#8217;ve studied is of paramount importance.</p><h1>6. Bible Book Study</h1><p>One of the most fruitful studies for me is studying a book of the Bible for an extended amount of time. Here are a few steps that I take to study a book of the Bible.</p><h2>1. Overview</h2><p>Read the Bible book several times. For example a book like Colossians is only four chapters. It&#8217;s a rather short book, one that you can read several times in a short amount of time. I begin to underline and highlight key verses that I believe are important. Then I make note of any important themes, whether they are theological or issues brought up by the writer.</p><h2>2. Outline</h2><p>Next, I outline the book. Where are the major headings in the book? This is where a good Bible, and or study Bible is helpful. Most modern Bibles have headings placed within the text. This will allow you to see the flow of the book and where a change of ideas or thoughts are made. For instance in Colossians Paul has a greeting, and an extended prayer. These are important distinctions to make. This also helps me remember where things are in the book as well.</p><h2>3. Themes</h2><p>Next, I begin to study themes within the Bible book. You may not notice a theme at first reading. You may notice several themes or issues within one book as well. Write them out, and mark where they are. A book like Colossians deals with the deity of Christ, his headship over the church, redemption, and the Christian walk. But why is Paul dealing with these things? You will notice that an error is arising in the local church that is attacking some of the doctrinal themes that Paul addresses.</p><h2>4. Chapter by Chapter, Verse by Verse</h2><p>Next, I start to study each chapter and verse. I&#8217;ve studied the forest, now I want to study the trees. This makes it much clearer to see and understand the Bible book, and interpretation and application becomes much more accessible. It also allows me to see the context within the larger scope of the letter.</p><p>As you can see, the Bible can be studied in a variety of ways. The key is to open it and begin. But don&#8217;t be discouraged. You aren&#8217;t going to learn everything that there is to know about the Bible is one sitting. It&#8217;s line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. But the more that you study it, the better acquainted you will be with it. And the more you are acquainted with it, the more it will transform your life.</p><p><strong>Lesson One: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-purpose-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Purpose of Study</a></strong></p><p><strong>Lesson Two: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-principles-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Principles of Study</a></strong></p>	100	\N	The Practice of Study	\N	/img_1726.jpg
631	2019-06-19 21:09:13	\N	\N	\N	<p>Eighteenth Century preacher, J.C. Ryle, said, &#8220;We must read our Bibles like men digging for hidden treasure.&#8221; The late pastor of Westminster Chapel, Martyn Lloyd-Jones, said, &#8220;Every time we consider or study the Bible we are, of necessity, worshipping.&#8221;</p><p>Someone once said, &#8220;God feeds the birds, but He doesn&#8217;t throw the food into their nests.&#8221; This is true for the Bible student too. If we want fed from the Word of God, then we must search for the food that will feed us.</p><p>Bible teacher, Howard Hendricks wrote, &#8220;Dusty Bibles lead to dirty lives. In fact, you are either in the Word and the Word is conforming you to the image of Jesus Christ, or you are in the world and the world is squeezing you into its mold.&#8221;</p><p>One of my favorite quotes from Pastor John Piper is, &#8220;Raking is easy, but it only yields leaves. Digging is hard, but you might find diamonds.&#8221;</p><p>The very first question in all of history was asked by the devil. “Has God said?” The first question ever recorded was a question of whether Eve knew the Word of God. If Eve couldn’t properly answer the serpent’s question then he could trap her. The devil knows the Word of God better than any one of us. It is important that you know Scripture and know how to properly study it.</p><h1>Principles of Bible Study</h1><p>&#8220;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth&#8221; (2 Timothy 2:15).</p><h2>1. Handling Scripture</h2><p>There is a right way, and there is a wrong way to interpreting Scripture. “Rightly dividing” in the Greek means to cut straight. This word was used to refer to a stone mason laying bricks in a straight line; a carpenter cutting or measuring a straight line; a farmer plowing a straight furrow; building a straight road or path. Paul who was a tent maker may have been referencing his trade of cutting wood straight or fabric straight to build quality tents. If you have ever tried to cut a piece of fabric straight, or a piece of wood straight you know how difficult it can be. You have to have a steady hand or something guiding you. My mother was a seamstress and it always amazed me how she could cut a straight line in a piece of fabric.</p><p>Crooked interpretation of Scripture leads to crooked living. Straight interpretation leads to straight living. If you are going to walk straight, you must interpret straight. Correct theology leads to correct living. Crooked theology leads to crooked living.</p><p>&#8220;As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction&#8221; (2 Peter 3:16).</p><p>Peter warned that Scripture could be &#8220;wrested&#8221; or in another words it can be twisted. Such twisting of Scripture leads to the destruction of souls. It destroys the one who is doing the twisting, and it destroys the souls of those who are taught twisted interpretations.</p><p>The greatest threat to Old Testament Israel and the New Testament church was the false prophet. It wasn’t idols; it was false doctrine concerning idols. The danger was the false prophet leading the people of God away from truth.</p><p>If we are to interpret Scripture properly then we must abide by the rules and principles of interpretation.</p><h2>2. Hermeneutics</h2><p>Biblical interpretation should strike fear into our heart with the realization that we are handling the very Words of the Eternal God. A God whose thoughts are not like our thoughts and whose ways are not like our ways (Isa. 55:8); a God who speaks (Matt. 4:4); The God who created the Heavens and the Earth by using words (Heb. 11:3). Understand this, that every word that He spoke had its intended purpose. When God said, “Let there be light” that is exactly what happened, light appeared (Gen 1:3). Therefore, God’s Word is intentional and has purpose (Isa. 55:11).</p><p>Hermeneutics is the science of Biblical interpretation. There is a correct way to interpret scripture and there is an incorrect way to interpret scripture. The Bible student is to be true to the text. It is not what is true to you, but what is true to the text. The Bible student is to read out of the text (Exegesis) and not into the text (Eisogesis). The belief that each of us could have our own interpretation of a particular Bible passage and that each of us is correct is called subjectivism. “Whatever you like is true for you and whatever I like is true to me.” This is what author R.C. Sproul calls subjectivism. In other words, what the Bible says is subjective to my interpretation. Truth only has one interpretation. It cannot be truth if there are multiple meanings. Then the interpretation is either true or it is false. This is why Biblical interpretation should be fearful to each of us. This is why it vitally important to interpret God’s intended purpose of every word that He has spoken.</p><p>Please keep in mind that the devil knows scripture (Matt. 4:3-11). While tempting Jesus, Satan took his liberty with interpretation and grossly took Scripture out of context. Jesus replied each time with, “It is written.” Satan attempted to single out a Bible verse and apply it to his cause. Jesus corrected Satan’s attempts by looking at how his flawed interpretation fit into the whole of scripture. We are no better than Satan when we twist and distort Scripture to fit our ideologies. We are no better than the devil when we misinterpret Scripture and take it out of context.</p><p>One must be converted before attempting to interpret the Bible. The unregenerate man is unable to discern the things of God (1 Cor. 2:14). His eyes have not yet been opened to truth. One must be filled with the Holy Spirit, for it is the Spirit that will lead us into all truth (John 16:13). However, being filled with the Spirit of God does not mean we are supernaturally enabled to know all things. Paul admonished the converted Timothy to, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15).</p><p>Author A.W. Tozer wrote, “The Holy Spirit never fills a man’s head. The Holy Spirit fills his heart.” The Spirit filled Bible student is to fill his mind with the Word. The Spirit filled heart will help interpret a Bible filled mind.</p><p>To be true to the text one pursues the context. Context is fundamental to Biblical interpretation. Bad theology has been built upon the vacillating foundation of incorrect contextualization. This is where many have erred throughout history, cherry picking a Biblical passage and making it a doctrine. They refuse to look at the whole counsel of the Word of God and instead choose to build their thoughts only on part of the Scriptures.</p><p>There are several actions we can take and several questions we can ask to ensure correct context. First, we must work our way out of the passage. What chapter is the verse in? What book is the chapter in? What type of book is it? Is it an historical book, a poetic book, a prophetic book, or an epistle? Who wrote this particular book of the Bible? Who were the author’s intended readers? When was this book written? How does this passage fit into the scope of scripture? Are there other texts to which I can reference? These are just a handful of questions that we must ask before we can correctly interpret a particular Bible passage. A good place to begin finding these answers is a good study Bible. Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, commentaries and handbooks are the tools that will help you mine for the vast riches of God’s Word.</p><h1>Tips for Studying and Interpreting Accurately</h1><p>•Each book of the Bible must be read properly. Reading history is not the same as reading poetry. Reading epistles is not the same as reading prophecy. Each literary genre must be given respect.</p><p>•Scripture interprets Scripture. Check your interpretation through the lens of the whole Bible. You cannot interpret the Bible through one verse; however, you can interpret one verse through the entire Bible.</p><p>•Don’t miss the forest for the trees. Read an entire book of the Bible before you attempt to interpret one verse from that particular book.</p><p>•Context, context, context! The context determines the meaning of the text. Historical context is the historical-cultural background of a Biblical text. Literary context relates to the particular type of book the passage is found in, and also relates to the words, sentences, and paragraphs that surround the passage. If our interpretation would not have made sense to the original writer and audience, we are probably going in the wrong direction. The true meaning of the Biblical text for us is what God originally intended it mean when it was first spoken.</p><p>Finally, beloved, one of Satan’s failed temptations in the wilderness was to entice Jesus to miraculously turn stones into bread. Let us not turn the living Bread into stone with our flawed interpretations. Instead, approach the Word of God with fear and trembling, leaning on the guidance of the Spirit to keep us true to the text.</p><p><strong>Lesson One: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-purpose-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Purpose of Study</a></strong></p><p><strong>Lesson Three: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-practice-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Practice of Study</a></strong></p>	100	\N	The Principles of Study	\N	/img_1725.jpg
632	2019-06-19 20:45:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15)</p><h1>Biblical Illiteracy</h1><p>&#8220;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children&#8221; (Hosea 4:6).</p><p>Study after study in the last quarter-century has revealed that American Christians increasingly don&#8217;t read their Bibles, don&#8217;t engage their Bibles, and don&#8217;t know their Bibles. It&#8217;s obvious: We are living in a post-biblically literate culture.</p><p>In his recent book <em>Religious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know—and Doesn&#8217;t,</em> Stephen Prothero writes, &#8220;The Gospel of John instructs Christians to &#8216;search the scriptures&#8217; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , but little searching, and even less finding is being done.&#8221; Prothero reports that more than 10 percent of Americans believe that Joan of Arc was Noah&#8217;s wife. Only 50 percent can name one of the four Gospels and less than half can name the first book of the Bible.</p><p>George Guthrie, Bible professor and author wrote: “For several years I have been conducting brief biblical literacy exams at the beginning of my New Testament Survey course. The questions on the exam are straightforward, multiple-choice queries such as: Which of these books is from the New Testament? Whom did Pontius Pilate release during Jesus&#8217; trial? How many temptations did Jesus experience in the wilderness? Where would you look in the Bible to find the Sermon on the Mount? Last fall the average score on the exam was 57 percent. The averages from classes over the past few years have ranged between 50 percent and 70 percent, but most of the time the average is closer to 50 percent. This is not unique to my students but is consistent with what other professors are finding at top Christian universities all over the United States. Our students, even those coming out of the church, simply are no longer grounded in the basics of the Bible&#8217;s story.”</p><p>Consider that a 2009 Nielsen Report showed that the average American watches 153 hours of television per month (about 5 hours per day; up 20 percent over a decade ago), and television sets are on in the average household for a whopping 8 hours 21 minutes per day. Hours more are spent online. It is little wonder that we struggle to find time and emotional/mental/spiritual space for reading the Bible. We are going to have to start turning off and tuning out in order to make room in our lives and hearts for God&#8217;s Word. If we will give just one-tenth the time the average American spends watching TV each day, we can read through the Bible in a year&#8217;s time.</p><p>LifeWay Research study found that only 45 percent of those who regularly attend church read the Bible more than once a week. Over 40 percent of the people attending are reading their Bibles occasionally—maybe once or twice a month, if at all. In fact, 18 percent of attenders say they never read the Bible.</p><p>“Ask one hundred church members if they have read the Bible today, and eighty-four of them will say no. Ask them if they have read the Bible at least once in the past week, and sixty-eight of them will say no. Even more disconcerting, ask those one hundred church members if reading or studying the Bible has made any significant difference in the way they live their lives. Only thirty-seven out of one hundred will say yes.</p><p>&#8220;One of the greatest tragedies in the American church is that we have Literate Believers who are Illiterate of the Bible.&#8221;</p><h1>The Shallow End of the Pool</h1><p>I was never taught to swim. I learned that the hard way when I was a child. I was with my cousins at the local public pool. I watched in wonder as both of my cousins jumped into the pool without any assistance from the wall or railing. I thought it looked like fun, and I didn’t know I couldn’t swim. So, I too, jumped into the deep end. It wasn’t long before I was close to drowning. Luckily, my cousin noticed I wasn’t coming back up and she grabbed me and asked, “Can you swim?” Well it was a little late to be asking that question. She and her brother and myself all assumed I could. But I couldn’t. And to this day I still refuse to leave the security of the wall of the pool. If God wanted me to swim, he would have given me gills.</p><p>I feel that we have forsaken the shallow end of the pool and pushed people into the deep end of the pool and left them to drown. We have come to expect certain spiritual maturity and spiritual expectation from people and yet we haven’t taught them how to read the instruction manual. Without proper training and instruction we only get marginal returns on little investment.</p><p>I would dare say that Bible reading trumps all other disciplines, including prayer. How else can you pray effectively and efficiently without learning it from the Bible? How else can you learn about fasting without scriptural basis? How can you know God’s plan for your finances without the Bible? How can you know about God without the Bible? I would say it would be impossible.</p><h1>The Purpose of Study</h1><p>Every Christian can know the Bible. It is God’s desire for every believer to know and understand the Word of God. Christians should not be handicapped in their ability to read and study the Bible. To know truth, attain joy, have victory and, grow spiritually you must be able to read, study and understand the Bible.</p><p>Before we can know the purpose of studying the Bible, we need to look at the characteristics of the Bible.</p><h1>The Bible is Inspired of God</h1><p>Inspiration can be defined as the process by which God directed individuals, incorporating their abilities and styles, to produce His message to humanity.</p><p>&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:16).</p><p>The word inspiration in the Greek can be translated God-breathed: “All scripture is God-breathed..”</p><p>&#8220;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost&#8221; (2 Peter 1:21).</p><h1>The Bible is Infallible</h1><p>Therefore, if God inspired all of Scripture, then it is without mistakes. Because God is perfect, the original autographs, the original transmissions of Scripture, must also be perfect.</p><p>&#8220;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple&#8221; (Psalm 19:7).</p><h1>The Bible is Inerrant</h1><p>The Bible is infallible in total, but inerrant in its parts. This implies that the Scriptures are trustworthy down to the tiniest of details.</p><p>&#8220;Every word of God is pure: He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar&#8221; (Proverbs 30:5–6)</p><h1>The Bible is Complete</h1><p>Nothing can be added, and nothing can be taken away from the Bible. The current Bible that we have is the complete Word of God. God is not going to add anything new the Bible, and He is not going to take anything out.</p><p>&#8220;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book&#8221; (Revelation 22:18–19).</p><h1>Benefits of Bible Study</h1><h2>1. Source of Truth</h2><p>Jesus said in John 17:17, “Your word is truth.” “Truth about what?” Truth about God; man; sin; salvation; truth about life; death; truth about men; women; family; money; all truth is there. The Word of God is profitable for doctrine, or teaching. Our doctrine, or teaching, only comes from Scripture. Doubts and unbelief can be dissolved with truth. How can you distinguish between truth and error? It is by handling truth, searching and studying truth. You will not find truth in psychology or philosophy. Some will never come to knowledge of truth, because they don’t seek the source of truth. Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth and the life.”</p><h2>2. Source of Joy</h2><p>You can replace the word joy with happiness or blessing. Whatever you want to call it, the Scripture will give you joy. “Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart” (Ps. 119:2).</p><p>“Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.” (Jeremiah 15:16).</p><p>“Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them” (Ps. 119:165)</p><p>People who are easily offended, and have thin skin don’t spend much time reading or studying the Bible. Because if they did, they wouldn’t get so upset with others so much. Because those who spend time in Scripture are more offended with themselves, or harder on themselves than others. But when they encounter the love of God through the Scripture and His long-suffering and patience, they will in turn be patient with others. Their joy can’t be turned off by offense.</p><h2>3. Source of Victory</h2><p>Three times the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness. Each time Jesus used Scripture to defeat that temptation. I don’t like to see the devil win. I don’t like seeing the world defeat me. I don’t like to see my flesh override my spiritual man. Knute Rockne used to say, “You can’t be beat, if you won’t be beat!” There’s not a reason why the devil should beat you up, or your flesh overcome your spirit. You have a weapon, and it’s not praise. Your weapon is the Sword of the Spirit!</p><p>“Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You” (Ps. 119:11).</p><p>You can’t beat temptation and you can’t defeat the devil if you don’t pick up your sword and learn to use it. You are in a war; a fight to the death and you can’t win without your weapon. The devil knows the one thing that can keep him from defeating you is the Word of God (Ephesians 6:10-18).</p><h2>4. Source of Spiritual Growth</h2><p>&#8220;Like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the Word, that by it you may grow in respect to salvation&#8221; (1 Peter 2:2).</p><p>Peter is saying that we should have an appetite for the Word of God, we should “long” for it. You cannot grow spiritually without the nourishing affects of Scripture. You must digest the Word of God to grow into a mature Christian.</p><p>“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God’” (Matthew 4:4).</p><p>Daily, consistent intake of the Bible will grow your mind, your heart and spirit.</p><p>The writer of Hebrews says he has some “hard things” to say to them, but they can’t understand them. They should have been growing spiritually to understand those things, but they were behind. He goes on to says that “solid food” is for the the mature who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil (Heb. 5:11-14).</p><p>The mark of spiritual maturity is not how much you know, but how much you use.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Nineteenth Century preacher and writer, Bishop J.C. Ryle said this;</p><p>“Begin reading your Bible this very day. The way to do a thing is to do it, and the way to read the Bible is actually to read it. It is not meaning, or wishing, or resolving, or intending, or thinking about it; that will not advance you one step. You must positively read. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you cannot read yourself, you must persuade somebody else to read to you. But one way or another, through eyes or ears, the words of Scripture must actually pass before your mind.”</p><p>Pastor J.H. Osborne wrote me a note one time that included this: “STUDY: Middle English (studie) from the Latin word “studetre”: to devote oneself to study from another Latin word: to beat-more at a contusion. To study is to beat and bruise a subject until you bring it’s life’s blood to the surface in the form of a contusion. Then and only then will you know its true heart and meaning. Study and beat that subject till it bleeds into your heart.”</p><p>It is the will of God that you read, study and understand the Bible. God doesn’t want you to be ignorant. And you can most certainly do it. Over the next several weeks we are going to attempt to help you, train you and lead you in how to study the Bible.</p><p><strong>Lesson Two: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-principles-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Principles of Study </a></strong></p><p><strong>Lesson Three: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2019/06/19/the-practice-of-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Practice of Study</a></strong></p>	100	\N	The Purpose of Study	\N	/img_1724.jpg

640	2019-02-26 16:32:09	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>There They Crucified Him (Luke 23:33)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With perfect understanding Luke takes only four words to describe the most meaningful event in all of history. The extraordinary economy of words available to Luke the physician and he sums everything up with just four words “There they crucified Him.” The other three Gospel writers leave out the particulars, allowing the imagination to put the pieces together as to what took place that dark day. The appalling business of crucifixion was all too familiar to those living under Roman rule, so Luke leaves the details to the historians. Luke takes less than half a dozen words to describe the Savior hanging from the tree.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>There</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“<strong><em>There </em></strong>they crucified Him.”</p>\r\n<p>The very first word is THERE. Where? Calvary. This is the only place in all of scripture where the name Calvary is found. Matthew, Mark and John have the original word in Greek translated as Golgotha, the place of the skull. Luke&#8217;s gospel had it translated as Calvary. Some historians say the small hill was shaped as a skull. Other historians say it was littered with the skulls of men who had already played out the horrible sentence of death. Either way it was a place of death.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Abraham knew about Calvary. Mt. Moriah was his Calvary. There he led Isaac up the mountain and tied him to an earthen altar. His only promised son, Isaac, would be sacrificed unto his God. But as Abraham lifted up that sharp dagger, the Lord spoke from the heavens. There was a ram caught in the thickets, the Lord had provided Himself a sacrifice in place of Abraham’s son (Gen. 22:1-19).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At Calvary the Lord had provided Himself as the Lamb. The Lamb led to the slaughter, silent and willing. The Lamb of God, which would take away the sins of the world. The Lamb, the spotless lamb.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Calvary was pictured in the outer courts of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. The brazen altar, ablaze with the fire that that would burn the flesh of the sacrifice. The priests would take the lamb and cut it’s throat, lay it upon the altar and begin to offer it up as a sweet savor unto the Lord. It smelled like burning flesh, but to God it was the sweet savor of atonement. Sins forgiven and pushed ahead another year. But it was only a picture of a place where sins would be forever dealt with. No longer the blood of bulls and goats and sheep. The precious blood of Jesus would take the place of sinners (Ex. 27:1-9).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Without the shedding of blood, there can be no remission of sins (Heb. 9:22). The wages of sins is death, and there, at Calvary, death would be taken care of once and for all (Rom. 6:23).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At Calvary, the place of the skull, much blood had been shed. But no blood before that day was spilled for the sins of humanity. At Calvary the blood that Jesus shed would purchase salvation for every sinner. Every sin of lying, stealing, fornication, murder, pride, vanity, jealousy, envy, bitterness, un-forgiveness, hatred, racism, doubt would be forever forgiven and washed away by that blood AT CALVARY.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>They</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There <strong><em>they </em></strong>crucified Him.”</p>\r\n<p>Luke’s treatment of the event not only lists the place, but the people that were present at that moment. The Hebrews, Greeks, and the Romans were there at that moment. The worlds of religion, culture and power united to endorse the death of the Son of God. It was the Passover so hundreds of thousands of Jews were gathered in that city of Jerusalem.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Centurion was there to hang Jesus to the Cross made of wood. He was there with his law and his legion of soldiers. The sign above Christ’s cross was written in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin: This is the King of the Jews (Matt. 27:37).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The mother of Jesus was present along with the women who loved Him. John the Beloved was present to hear Jesus “behold thy mother.” Simon Peter denied him and ran away cursing but another Simon was there who was compelled to carry the heavy Cross of Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Who can forget the High Priests and the Jewish council? They stood by mocking, and jeering. They reviled Him, the Son of Man who they pierced. The man Christ Jesus wounded in the house of His friends (Zech. 13:6). Caiaphas was there, who had prophesied as the High Priest that this man would have to die for the sins of the people. How soon he had forgotten his own prophecy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Two criminals were crucified that day along with Jesus. One to his left and one to his right. Thieves who were sentenced to this horrible death, but in between them hanged the vindicator of their sins. One rejected him, the other cried for Jesus to take him to Paradise. Little did he know, that one day that One lifted up beside him would draw all unto Him.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But there were others there that day. You and I were there. Romans and Jews weren’t the only ones who were guilty of killing the Son of God. Yes, you and me killed him. “He who knew no sin, became sin, that we may become the righteousness of God.” Our sins were present.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost stood and declared, <strong>&#8220;</strong>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain&#8221; (Acts 2:23,36).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We killed Jesus. Your sins and my sins murdered the Precious Son of God. Each of us took a turn with the hammer and nailed His hands to the rugged cross. Each of us took a load of the weight of His sovereign body on the cross and shoved it into the hole to allow Him to hang.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We cannot stand from a distance and watch as the authorities inject a prisoner sentenced to death. You and I are guilty. We killed Him. Your sins and my sins. Little sins and big sins. He became sin for us.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Crucified</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There they <strong><em>crucified </em></strong>Him.”</p>\r\n<p>The Jews had tried to kill Jesus many times before this awful day. They tried to throw Him off a mountain. They tried to stone Him. But it could not be any of these ways.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Crucifixion was an awful death. Roman government found a way to put fear into the people they governed and ruled over. Stoning or cutting one’s head off was not sufficient. They instead tortured their victims to scare others from trying to rebel against them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It was prophesied that the Messiah would have to suffer. But surly not like this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Crucifixion was a cruel way to die. Death by hanging was not frightening enough to the Romans. They manufactured their own cross. All it took was a wooden upright post, and a crosspiece with arms outstretched. Then they nailed the screaming victim to that accursed cross and hung Him up to die. Every form of agony assailed the sufferer. Open wounds, exposure to the weather, cramps, thirst, starvation, fever, flies, infection. Each breath was intolerable. There was no comfort the victim. Jesus would also have a crown of thorns put upon Him. Pressing the twisted pieces of thorns to cut and lacerate His sovereign head.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The open wounds from His scourging would not be sufficient enough for the atonement. The wages of sin is death, the Lamb was not only to be punished, it would have to die.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As if the hanging was not enough, people mocked him. Some gambled for his clothes. Others cried for Him to call for Elijah. “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As death closed in, the darkness began to descend. The Earth began to moan for it’s Creator. Angels waited at a distance for Him to call for them. The disciples prayed for Him to come off that cross, but instead He cried “It is Finished” and He gave up the ghost.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Him<strong><br /></strong></h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“There they crucified <em><strong>Him</strong>.</em>”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At Calvary, the Greeks, Hebrews, Romans, sinners, mockers, liars, thieves, murderers and religious murdered a man. It was not Caesar. It was not a government official. It was not an insurrectionist. It was not a philanthropist. It was not a do-gooder.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No, this was not just a good man they killed: &#8220;For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die&#8221; (Romans 5:7).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Allow me to tell you who exactly they crucified that day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Jesus was the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world- John 1:29</li>\r\n<li>He was the Lamb led to the slaughter- Isaiah 53</li>\r\n<li>He was the Word made flesh- John 1:1, 14</li>\r\n<li>He was the Son of God- Matthew 16:16</li>\r\n<li>He was the Alpha and the Omega- Revelation 1:8</li>\r\n<li>He was the King of the Jews- John 18:19</li>\r\n<li>He was the King of Kings – Revelation 19:16</li>\r\n<li>He was the Lord of Lords- Rev. 19:16</li>\r\n<li>He was the Great I Am- Exodus 3:14</li>\r\n<li>He was the Good Shepherd- John 10:11</li>\r\n<li>He was the Vine- John 15:1, 5</li>\r\n<li>He was the Light- John 8:12</li>\r\n<li>He was the Bread of Life- John 6:35</li>\r\n<li>He was the Living Water- John 4:10</li>\r\n<li>Jesus was the Way, the Truth, and the Life- John 14:6</li>\r\n<li>He was the Door- John 10:9</li>\r\n<li>Jesus was the Resurrection and Life- John 11:2</li>\r\n<li>Before Abraham was Jesus was I AM- John 8:58</li>\r\n<li>He was the Branch of David– Jeremiah 33:15</li>\r\n<li>He was the Root of Jesse- Romans 15:12</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Paul said that in Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9). The fullness of the Godhead. All of God was in Jesus. When you looked at Jesus you seen the Father, because He and the Father were one in the same. Thomas looked at Jesus and declared “My Lord and my God!” Jesus was the Word made flesh, meaning that Jesus was God manifest in flesh (Jn. 1:1-14).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But Jesus was not just God, but He was in fact all man as well. As God He could calm the storms. As man He could sleep on the boat. As man He could thirst, but be the Living Water that would quench the thirst of all men forever. As man he could get tired, but as God He would give rest to all that were heavy laden and worn out. As man he could get hungry and fight the devil. But as God He was the Bread of Life that could help you conquer Satan under your feet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There they crucified Him! Him! The Lord of glory. God manifest in the flesh.<br />The fullness of the Godhead bodily. The only true God. The flesh was killed and marred for your sins. And after three days Jesus resurrected that temple of His flesh.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They crucified Him, but He justified us. We killed Him, but He gave us life. They buried Him, but he cleansed us. We mocked Him, but He forgave us.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There they crucified Him, but here you can receive Him. Right now, wherever you are you can receive the One who died and rose from the dead for you. Simply believe in the Son of God (Jn. 8:24). Believe that He is God, and that He can save you. The Holy One provided the means for your forgiveness, but you cannot be passive about asking for forgiveness. You must repent of your sins, forsaking your old way of life and turning towards Jesus (Mk. 1:5). But just as Jesus was buried after His death, you must be buried with Him in baptism (Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12). The One who died, has the name that can save (Acts 4:12). In baptism we invoke the name of Jesus Christ for the washing away of your sins, signifying the burial of the old sinful lifestyle (Acts 2:38). Finally, we are resurrected into new life, just as He rose from the dead. The Holy Spirit fills our hearts, giving us a down payment on the future glorification that we inherit (Eph. 1:14-16).</p>\r\n<p>Do not hesitate, do not wait. There they crucified Him, but here today you can receive Him.</p>\r\n	100	\N	There They Crucified Him	\N	/eberhard-grossgasteiger-1201375-unsplash.jpg

644	2019-01-03 08:57:51	\N	\N	\N	\r\n<p>I believe the Bible, which consists of both the Old\r\nTestament and New Testament, is the divinely inspired and inerrant Word of God.\r\nHoly men of God were moved upon by the Holy Spirit to communicate to us God’s\r\ndirect commands (2 Peter 1:19-21). Being that Scripture is the Word of God it\r\nis profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction and for training in\r\nrighteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>“</strong>Long ago, at\r\nmany times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in\r\nthese last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of\r\nall things, through whom also he created the world” (Hebrews 1:1-2). God spoke\r\nusing many different ways and various methods. God spoke audibly to Adam (Gen.\r\n2:16-17). He spoke directly to Moses and the children of Israel in giving them\r\nthe Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:1-3). Using men such as Moses, Samuel, Elijah,\r\nJeremiah, Ezekiel and Amos, God spoke through men to communicate to His people.\r\nThese verbal messages included promises, prophetic oracles, and messages of\r\njudgment. These spoken words, through the human lips of men, carried the weight\r\nand gravity of God’s authority. Though these messages were given by men under\r\nthe inspiration of the Spirit of God (2 Peter 1:19-21) they were considered\r\ntrue and without error. Any man who spoke as a prophet, but who had not been\r\nsent by God, was considered a false prophet and was to be punished (Deut.\r\n18:20-22). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are several instances in the Bible where the Word of\r\nGod was written down. It was the finger of God that inscribed God’s laws on the\r\ntablets of stone given to Moses (Ex. 31:18, 32:16, 34:1, 28). During Israel’s\r\nwanderings Moses wrote these laws and promises of God down (Deut. 31:9-13,\r\n24-26). After the death of Moses, and the eventual conquest of Canaan Joshua\r\nadded to those written laws (Josh. 24:26). The preservation of the Word of God\r\nallowed the Scriptures to be memorized, studied and propagated. By the arrival\r\nof Jesus the Old Testament canon had been completed and organized by the people\r\nof Israel. No less than 64 times Jesus quoted and referred to many of the Old\r\nTestament books, laws, stories, history and their reliability (MacArthur, 2007).\r\nJesus Christ put His seal upon the Old Testament canon when he said, “so that\r\non you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of\r\nrighteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you\r\nmurdered between the sanctuary and the altar” (Matt. 23:35), this statement\r\nencompasses the entire Old Testament according to the Hebrew chronology (MacArthur,\r\n2007). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The New Testament canon continues where the Old Testament\r\nleft off, by claiming to be God’s inspired Word spoken and written by men. Paul\r\nsays, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for\r\nreproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16).\r\nPeter claims that Paul’s letters should be included as Scripture (2 Pet.\r\n3:15-16). The New Testament carries the same weight and gravity of God’s\r\nauthority as the Old Testament (1 Cor. 14:37, 2 Cor. 13:3). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible is God’s infallible Word. Scripture is infallible\r\nin that the original manuscripts contain no errors. “The law of the Lord is\r\nperfect” (Ps. 19:7). The Scripture is infallible because its Author is infallible.\r\nScribes and copiers have made mistakes in transcribing the Scriptures, but that\r\ndoes not negate the infallibility of Scripture. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible is not only infallible it is also inerrant. <strong>“</strong>Every\r\nword of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him” (Pro.\r\n30:5). God, who is true, has given us His Word that is true. We can trust in\r\nthe truthfulness of Scripture because the Author is trustworthy (Isa. 65:16,\r\nJer. 10:10, John 3:33, 17:3, 1 John 5:20). Jesus boldly declared, “thy word is\r\ntruth” (John 17:17). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Scripture is the God-breathed written Word, which\r\nwas penned by human men who were moved upon and inspired by the Spirit of God.\r\nFurthermore, the Word of God is Jesus Christ who was manifested in flesh to\r\nreveal God the Father, and to redeem sinful humanity from the eternal\r\nconsequences of sin (John 1:1-2,14). Our very lives depend and live upon this\r\nwritten Word of God (Matt. 4:4). The Word of God is the written form of words\r\nthat has been given to reveal God’s character, intent, and revelation. It is\r\nthrough the written Word that we can know God’s plan for redemption. </p>	100	\N	Theology of Scripture	\N	/aaron-burden-1054030-unsplash-2.jpg

650	2018-10-08 01:58:29	\N	\N	\N	<p>Much has been written about the life of King David. He was an extraordinary man. His rise from shepherding his father’s flock in the pasturelands to defeating a giant foe to give Israel victory. From running for his life from an jealous king to ruling over the nation of Israel. King David’s life is worthy to be lauded and praised. Not only was David successful in his accomplishments, he was also a man of God. The mighty warrior and ruler could also be a poet and psalmist. His lyrics were immersed in his love for Jehovah. When the Lord chose David to be Israel’s king He said, “<em>I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, which shall fulfill all my will”</em> (Acts 13:22).</p><p>The Old Testament foreshadows the gospel of Jesus Christ in several instances. This holds true for David. First, we should take into consideration that David was from the tribe of Judah, which Jacob prophesied would produce a king (Gen. 49:10). With this in mind the Lord made a covenant with David that his throne would be everlasting (2 Sam. 7:1-17). Through this Davidic Covenant Jesus Christ would be the rightful heir to David’s throne through both His humanity and divinity (Matt. 1:1-17; 22:41-46; Heb. 7:14).</p><p>It’s not only through David as a type and shadow of Jesus Christ that the gospel is pictured. Rather, the gospel is found in David’s failure and forgiveness. Despite David being a man after God’s own heart, David had a significant failure. Perhaps there is one Scripture that all of us can relate to concerning David, “<em>Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite</em>” (1 Kings 15:5). Many of us want to be men and women after God’s own heart, but we feel our own failures and shortcomings keep us from such lofty desires. But it is here in our state of failure that God reaches down and lets us experience the good news of forgiveness. All know what it feels like to be unworthy of God’s grace and love. It is those who have been forgiven much who know what it is to love much (Lk. 7:47).</p><p>David had experienced the gospel of Jesus Christ long before anyone else had. He knew what it was like to be a sinner, and taste the bitterness of guilt. But he also knew what it was like to be acquainted with the freedom of forgiveness.</p><p>This is the Gospel According to David.</p><h1>1. The Sinner</h1><p>David had been king of Israel for quite sometime when he had his moral failure known as the “matter of Uriah the Hittite.” It was the time that kings went out to war, and David stayed at home. David went to his rooftop at evening only to set his eyes upon a woman bathing. Bathsheba was married to Uriah, one of David’s mighty men of war (2 Sam. 23:39). Uriah was away at battle trying to attain victory, while David stayed at home only to surrender his character and good name. David had another battle that he should have been waging against lust and temptation. However, he failed to subdue his desires and had Bathsheba brought to him to commit adultery. To make matters worse, she became pregnant with David’s child. And as if that wasn’t enough David tried to cover it up by attempting to have Uriah come home and stay with his wife for a few nights. When David’s plans to hide his sin failed, he committed a worse error than the first and had Uriah sent back to battle only to have him put in the frontline to ensure his death (2 Sam. 11:1-27).</p><p>The Lord sent Nathan the prophet to confront David for his egregious sin. Once David heard Nathan’s message he felt conviction and immediately asked the Lord to forgive his sins (2 Sam. 12:1-14). From this event and prophetic confrontation we are given David’s prayer in Psalm fifty-one.</p><blockquote><p>“Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.” (Psalms 51:1-4)</p></blockquote><h3>David uses three words to describe his failure (Ps. 51:3-5,9,13):</h3><ul><li>transgression</li><li>iniquity</li><li>sin</li></ul><h2>Transgression</h2><p>In the original language “<em>transgress</em>” meant “<em>to rebel</em>.” Another definition for transgress is to “<em>go beyond</em>.” David rebelled and went beyond God’s laws and committed adultery and murder, and a whole host of other sins. Jehovah had given Israel His laws in which God did not want man to kill (Ex. 20:13), to commit adultery (Ex. 20:14), or for a man to covet his neighbor’s wife (Ex. 20:17). David had broken three of the Ten Commandments in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</p><p>We become transgressors when we go beyond what God has commanded. God’s laws represent His character and what He expects of His people. Through the Law God determines what is right and wrong. Furthermore, God decides the judgment for those who disobey His laws. Transgressors break the laws that God has ordained.</p><p>David could agree with the writer of Proverbs when he said, “<em>Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard</em>” (Proverbs 13:15). Many have experienced the difficult path that transgressions has led them to. David would need brought back from the awful course that his transgressions brought him to.</p><h2>Iniquity</h2><p>In Hebrew the word “<em>iniquity</em>” means “<em>perversion</em>” or “<em>crooked dealing.</em>” David’s actions were perverse and depraved. What God declared to be straight, David decided to distort. David’s actions were part of a deeper problem for he notes that he was born with iniquity: “<em>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me” </em>(Psalms 51:5).</p><p>Man is born with this depraved and perverse nature. Humanity has a bent towards the type behavior David displayed. Adam’s disobedience produced sin and its iniquitous nature is given to all of us (Rom. 5:12-19). Unfortunately, there’s nothing within our power to escape this sinful nature that we are born with. The disease of iniquity is in each of us and it corrupts our hearts (Jer. 17:9). And what comes from our hearts defiles us (Matt. 15:18-20). Someone adequately said, “<em>We are not sinners because we sin. We sin because we are sinners</em>.” David acted in accordance to his sin nature, and not only does he need his sins forgiven, he must have his heart and nature changed.</p><h2>Sin</h2><blockquote><p>“Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me” (Ps. 51:1-3).</p></blockquote><p>The Hebrew definition for “<em>sin</em>” is to “<em>miss the mark</em>” or “<em>fall short</em>.” Paul wrote, “<em>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</em>” (Rom. 3:23). What mark did David miss, and what mark do we miss? We miss the mark of God’s character. Paul wrote that our sinful condition leaves us short of God’s glory. The glory of God is used to describe His divine attributes which includes his righteousness, and holiness. Adam and Eve were created to reflect God’s glory as His image bearers. However, sin began to distort humanity’s ability to accurately reflect God’s glory, therefore, we come up short and miss the mark. On the other hand, sin is deeper than missing the mark. Sin stains (Jam. 1:27). Sin is considered idolatry (Col. 3:5). Sin separates us from God (Isa. 59:2). Finally, sin leads to death (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23; Jam. 1:15).</p><p>David recognizes his failure as depraved, rebellious, and falling short of God’s glory. He acknowledged that it was against God that these atrocities were committed: “<em>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest</em>” (Psalms 51:4).</p><p>When we sin, like David, we come short of God’s holiness, righteousness and glory. Our transgressions, iniquity and sin keep us <em>short</em> of God’s glory, but that is an eternal distance between our sin and God’s glory. What David needed, and what we need is to be reconciled to God.</p><h1>2. The Savior</h1><p>The psalm begins with David throwing himself upon God’s mercy (Ps. 51:1). David acknowledged that he was in need of forgiveness. The first step towards forgiveness and salvation from our sin is the admission that we need rescued. David&#8217;s prayer is teeming with repentance. Guilt is such a heavy burden to carry. David longed to be relieved of such a weight, and he cast Himself at Jehovah’s feet to find mercy.</p><p>David committed two sins for which the Law of Moses offered no forgiveness. Deliberate adultery and murder deserved the penalty of death. When David says, “<em>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering</em>” it was due to the fact that there wasn’t an acceptable sacrifice for adultery and murder. There wasn’t an ox, goat, or lamb that he could offer to bring relief. Rather, David appeals to three essential principles of the gospel: God’s mercy, love, and compassion.</p><h2>Mercy</h2><p>“<em>Have mercy upon me, O God!</em>” A man who stands condemned needs mercy. A woman who knows the gall of guilt and reproach desires mercy. David knew that he could get mercy from one Person. David didn’t need a priest, or a counselor. No, David needed the mercy of God. God will give pity upon the poor soul who knows they need saving. David, and anyone else can find God&#8217;s mercy when they repent. God is not willing that any should perish, but that all would come to repentance (2 Pt. 3:9).</p><p>Bible commentator, James Montgomery Boice notes: “<em>We cannot come to God on the basis of his justice; justice strikes us with fear and causes us to hide from him. We are not drawn to God by his wisdom; wisdom does not embolden us, though we stand in awe of it. No more does omniscience, omnipotence, or omnipresence. The only reason we dare come to God and dare hope for a solution to our sin problem is his mercy.</em>”</p><p>God desires to show us mercy for he says, “<em>I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion</em>” (Exod. 33:12–23).</p><p>When the diseased and hurting knew Jesus was near they cried out for His mercy (Matt. 15:22; Mk. 10:47-48). The publican who wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to pray in the synagogue wept and said unto God, “<em>Have mercy upon me, a sinner</em>” (Lk. 18:13).</p><h2>Love</h2><p>The New International Version translates this first verse as: “<em>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your unfailing-love</em>.” The gospel of Jesus Christ is a message of love. Sinners need the mercies of God, but they also need to know the love of God. The Father is abounding in love for He says, “<em>‘The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin</em>’” (Exodus 34:6-7a). St. John added that God is love (1 Jn. 4:8).</p><p>Jesus Christ embodied the love of God, and His purpose was to display God’s love to the world: “<em>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life</em>” (Jn. 3:16). God’s love was demonstrated when Jesus Christ laid down his life for sinners (Rom. 5:8).</p><p>David didn’t need a bullock, turtle dove or goat. No, David needed the Lamb of God which would take away the sins of the world (Jn. 1:29).</p><h2>Compassion</h2><p>Compassion is the ability to feel what others feel. Compassion is desperately missing in our world today. When others are broken and hurting we tend to turn away. David made the petition for God to blot out his transgressions based upon God’s compassion.</p><p>But how can a Holy God feel compassion towards those who need saving from sin. God is without sin, and is not tempted (Jam. 1:13). However, through Jesus Christ He is our high priest who feels for our weaknesses. Jesus was tempted in every way that we are and yet He was without sin (Heb. 4:15). God, through Jesus Christ, is long suffering and compassionate towards us: “<em>The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy</em>” (Psalms 145:8).</p><p>David appealed to God’s love, mercy, and compassion. Now, he needed saving.</p><h1>3. The Saving</h1><p>David’s transgression, iniquity and sin was matched with God’s love, mercy, and compassion. But how can God’s mercy, love, and compassion be adequately applied to sinners? Salvation is going to be applied by a gracious God through blotting out, washing thoroughly, and cleansing inwardly.</p><h2>Blot Out</h2><p>David desired to have God blot out his transgressions and iniquities (Ps. 51:1,9). In the original language to blot out means to have something removed from a book. David wanted no remembrance of his sin. If there was a record or account of his evil deeds he desired them to be removed. Only the God of grace and mercy can promise to remove our sins and remember them no more: “<em>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins</em>” (Isaiah 43:25). And again: “<em>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea</em>” (Micah 7:19).</p><h2>Wash and Cleanse</h2><p>Sin stains and soils, and those who are dirty must be cleaned. David recognized he need for cleansing when he said, “<em>wash me thoroughly from my iniquities</em>,” “<em>wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow</em>” and, “<em>create in me a clean heart</em>” (Ps. 51:2,7,10). Cleanse means to purge, or as Boice comments, “it literally means to de-sin.”</p><p>David said, “<em>purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean</em>.” Hyssop was a plant that could be found growing in the crevices of buildings, and it would be bundled together to be used as a brush. At the first Passover the Lord told the people of Israel to gather some hyssop and dip into the blood of the sacrificed lamb to spread it over the door of their homes (Ex. 12:22). When the death angel came into the camp he would see the blood over the door and “Passover that house.” When a person was healed of their leprosy the priest would take some hyssop and dip into the blood of the sacrifice and sprinkle it on the one who had been cleansed (Lev. 14:5-7). David, needed the covering and the cleansing.</p><p>What can wash away the stain of sin? Only the blood of Jesus Christ (Matt. 26:28)! “<em>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin</em>” (1 Jn. 1:7). “<em>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God</em>” (Hebrews 9:14).</p><p>David didn’t just need his sins washed away, he also needed a new heart and a renewed spirit (Ps. 51:10). The prophet Ezekiel proclaimed that a new covenant would come in which God would give everyone new hearts and a new spirit (Ezekiel 36:26). Sinners can only receive a new heart and a new spirit if they have been born again of the water and Spirit (John 3:3-6).</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>King David could not offer a sacrifice large enough to bring God’s forgiveness. Despite being wealthy and ruling over a vast domain, David would not be able to pay for Jehovah’s salvation. All that David could offer was a broken and contrite heart:</p><blockquote><p>“For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise” (Psalms 51:16-17)</p></blockquote><p>Beloved, this is all that we can offer in exchange for salvation. A man or woman whose heart is broken because of their sin will be given salvation freely (Rom.5:15; 6:23). The spirit that mourns over past failures will be spiritually healed. The crowds in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost heard Peter preach the gospel message, and they were cut to the heart (Acts 2:37). Once they heard that message and their hearts were broken, Peter then gave them the application: “<em>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost</em>” (Acts 2:38). Your sin-sick heart can be made clean in baptism. Your contrite spirit can be renewed by receiving the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Sin will steal your joy. The lifestyle of the world will not bring you fulfillment or satisfaction. Iniquity will rob you of your sleep and rest. David said, “<em>Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice</em>” (Ps. 51:8). The Lord’s conviction will break the bones of confidence. David longed for joy, gladness and rejoicing to return. David prayed,</p><blockquote><p>“Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit..and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. O Lord, open this my lips; and my mouth shall she forth thy praise” (Ps. 51:12-15).</p></blockquote><p>Once David’s heart and spirit would be restored it would restore his joy and praise. Praise and worship is stifled by sin. Because praise is from the abundance of the heart. If the heart is sick with sin it will not yield worship. But the heart that is cleansed and healed from sin will sing forth the praises of God. What happens to the heart effects the heart. “<em>I will praise you with an upright heart, when I learn your righteous rules</em>” (Psalms 119:7).</p><p>Your praise will be restored, and your witness will be inflamed. “<em>Then I will teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee</em>” (Ps. 51:13). The message of salvation must be shared with other who remain in their sin. David confessed his sin to God, now he wants to confess to others of his forgiveness. Sinners are converted when we share what Jesus Christ has done for us.</p><p>David had a first-hand experience with the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was a man acquainted with sin and God’s grace. If you are in need of forgiveness take a few moments to read through Psalm fifty-one and witness the gospel according to David.</p>	100	\N	The Gospel According to David	\N	/The-Book-Of-Psalms-David-Blank.jpg
651	2018-08-20 13:21:07	\N	\N	\N	<p>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &#8220;In you shall all the nations be blessed.&#8221; So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith (Galatians 3:7-9).</p><h2>The Gospel Preached to Abraham</h2><p>The message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is found in figures and types throughout the Old Testament. Though stories and texts may not explicitly spell out the gospel, it can be seen in the shadows. It is important to understand that the Old Testament is necessary for understanding and interpreting the New Testament. And on the other hand the New Testament is needed to better clarify the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament.</p><p>Any student of Scripture will tell you that Abraham is an important figure to redemptive history. He is considered to be the Father of Faith, and the father of us all (Rom 4:16). His life and story foreshadow the message of the gospel. When the Apostle Paul wanted to defend the message of the gospel he consistently used Abraham as his example because Abraham’s life hints at the gospel. Whether Abraham knew it or not, he was a living picture of the gospel. This stranger’s odyssey through the deserts of the Ancient Near East left footprints in the dust leading us to the gospel.</p><p>Galatians 3:8 says that the gospel was preached to Abraham. The gospel message was that Jews and Gentile alike would be justified by faith. So the gospel in its plainest form was preached to Abraham. Abraham’s life and faith embodied the gospel message. It was Jesus that said that Abraham seen Jesus’ day and rejoiced (Jn. 8:56). Abraham caught a glimpse of the gospel before it was even initiated. I want us to walk in the footsteps of the faith and see the Gospel according to Abraham (Rom. 4:12).</p><h2>Election by Grace</h2><p>The message of the gospel begins with the acknowledgement that we are sinners (Rom. 3:23). If the Gospel is going to be applied to your life then this fundamental truth cannot be overlooked. To remove sin from the gospel message is like removing sickness from hospitals they wouldn’t be needed. Hospitals and doctors are needed to help cure the sick and diseased. The gospel of Jesus Christ is needed to cure humanity’s sin-sick soul.</p><p>Abraham is introduced in Genesis chapter twelve. He and his family were from the Ur of Chaldees. However, Abraham and his family served other gods (Josh. 24:2-3). Though Abraham was from the lineage of Shem, Noah’s son, he was a sinner. Noah and his family were saved from the wrath of God, but they had a stowaway on the ark known as sin. Sin’s consequences were being eradicated in the flood, but the seed of sin was hiding in the hearts of Noah and his family. Sin was inescapable for man. In order for the promised plan of redemption given to Adam and Eve to continue then God would have to work through a people (Gen. 3:15). The seed of the woman would come through the lineage of Shem and and ultimately Abraham.</p><p>But Abraham was a sinner too. Abraham was not worthy to be called the friend of God. Abraham wasn’t worthy to be called and used of God. But that’s exactly what took place. In Genesis chapter twelve we listen in to God’s call of Abraham. He is to leave his family, and his country. He is to follow God’s leading in order to become a father of nations and kings (Gen. 12:1-3).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, none of us were worthy of God’s call. Each of us were lost in sin, but Jesus brought us in. Nothing within our flesh can be considered good (Rom. 7:18). It is not by our works, or by our righteousness that we are saved from our sin. No, on the contrary, it is God’s mercy that has kept us from being consumed (Lam. 3:22). It is the grace of God which reached to where we were, in spite of our sinfulness, that picked us up. Just as God found Abraham in the Ur of Chaldees, God found you. You didn’t find the Man Upstairs, like He was hiding from you. No, like Adam and Eve we were hiding from God.</p><p>Abraham’s credentials and heritage didn’t lead to his eventual calling. No, Abraham’s father was an idolater just as he was. This is the introduction to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Nothing in your family tree can save you, and nothing in your family tree can keep God’s grace from choosing you. It is for male and female, Jew and Gentile (Gal. 3:28). It is for the poor and it is for the rich. While we were yet sinners, Christ Jesus died for us. While were God’s enemy, due to our sin, His grace touched us. You are not too bad for the blood. Never has there been a sinner refused. Those who will recognize their sin, and come to the One who save them, will be saved from their sin.</p><h2>Righteousness Through Faith</h2><p>How then can a sinner be made righteous? How can that which is dirty be made clean? Can a righteous God make sinners righteous? Can they who are guilty be justified? Paul writes that there is none righteous, no not one (Rom. 3:10). What hope does sinful humanity have?</p><p>What does Scripture say? Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness (Rom. 4:3). It was not Abraham’s works that justified him. As we have taken into account, it was not his family tree that brought him salvation. No, it was his belief and obedience to God’s plan. The one who believes God will be counted as righteous. Abraham was justified by faith. The story of Abraham tells us that a right standing before God is not possessed based upon our good works, rather it is based upon our faith in God who in turn justifies. Justification is “just as if I had never done it.” Justification is making innocent those who are guilty.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have no claim to stand in the presence of a holy God. Our sin separates us from Him (Isa. 59:2). But through Jesus Christ, we can be made righteous. Jesus takes our sin, and gives us His righteousness. Jesus Christ became what he wasn’t, so we could be made what we weren’t. Jesus was made sin, in order that we could be come the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Cor. 5:21).</p><p>Every other religion commands that someone do all of the work. They are to offer the correct sacrifices. They are to pray the correct prayer. They are to take a particular pilgrimage. But Jesus Christ took our place. We can only offer Him our filthy rags (Isa. 64:6). However, redemption and justification has come through Jesus Christ, whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood, to be received by faith (Rom. 3:24-25).</p><h2>Salvation Through Substitution</h2><p>As we gaze at the story of Abraham through the lens of the New Testament, we can see sacrifice being prepared for our justification. Abraham believed and trusted God. A man of faith journeying towards God’s promises. Abraham was stopped in his tracks when God tested him with the command to offer his only begotten son, Isaac, as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah (Gen. 22:1-2). A father having to offer his promised son as a sacrifice. Can you imagine the emotions Abraham felt? But Abraham believed and trusted, and led his only son up the mountain. Isaac willingly carried the wood up the mountain that would be part his own altar. Isaac softly asked, “My father, behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham prophetically answered, “God will provide himself the lamb for the sacrifice” (Gen. 22:7-8). Next, Isaac willingly laid on the altar in obedience to Abraham. Just as Abraham was about to slay his only son, a voice from heaven said, “Abraham! Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God” (Gen. 22:12). And just then Abraham seen a ram caught in a thicket, and he offered it in Isaac’s stead. Abraham had enough faith to believe that God was able to raise Isaac from the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive him back (Heb. 11:17-19).</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, a substitute had been provided. God provided the lamb for the sacrifice (Jn. 1:35-36). Something took the place of Isaac. Abraham’s only son was willing to lay down his life for his father, and as such foreshadowed the coming Messiah. But it was the ram caught in the thicket that took his place. And it is Jesus Christ who willingly laid down his life for sinners. God displayed his righteousness by providing a blood sacrifice. What we could not pay was provided for us. The blood of Jesus Christ provided our salvation, our justification and righteousness. But this is applied through faith in Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:1-2). Jesus Christ died for sinners, but through His resurrection we are made alive in Him. Our sins had brought the condemnation of death, but Jesus has brought us life.</p><h2>Circumcision of the Heart</h2><p>Once Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness, God gave him the sign of circumcision. This outward mark identified Abraham and his descendants as belonging to the Lord. Part of God’s covenant with Abraham was this painful cutting way of the flesh. But anyone who refused this circumcision would be “cut off” (Gen. 17:14).</p><p>This marking, however, was only a sign pointing towards a greater sign of identification. Abraham’s God desired to have a sign far superior than the one given to Abraham. This circumcision was going to be of the heart. The superior circumcision was alluded to in the Law and Prophets:</p><blockquote><p>“And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live” (Deuteronomy 30:6)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules” (Ezekiel 36:25-27)</p></blockquote><p>Since the inauguration of salvation through Jesus Christ this new circumcision is available. No longer is this a painful cutting away in the flesh, but it is a cutting away in the heart. The spiritual man is united to Christ in this act of faith. But how can you have this circumcision applied today? When we are united to Christ through faith, we indeed are putting off the old man. No longer are we subservient to sin. Death to sin and alive to Christ is our new position (Rom. 6:5-11). The cutting away of sin in our hearts is the desired result. But faith alone is not the answer. It is repenting of your sins. Jesus Christ deliberately paid the price to free us from sin, but we must respond in faith to the One who saves, then repent of our sins. The forsaking of sin is figurative in the cutting away of flesh in circumcision. Just as Christ died for our sins at Calvary, we too must die to sin. On the other hand, just as Jesus was buried after His death, we too must be buried.</p><blockquote><p>“In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses” (Colossians 2:11-13)</p></blockquote><p>Baptism is now the circumcision that replaces the outward cutting way. As we are buried with Christ in baptism we put off the body of sins in the flesh. We are then united to Christ Jesus through faith in repentance and baptism. The act of baptism is not an outward profession of an inner faith. No, it is the washing away of your sins, and new identification as followers of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38; 4:12). Just as Abraham was identified as a follower of God in the Old Testament, we now follow Jesus Christ.</p><p>Circumcision was part of the covenant between God and Abraham. Thus, baptism is part of our covenant with Jesus. If Abraham did not perform this act of circumcision, and if his heirs did not perform this act, then they would be outside of the covenant. If the act of regeneration, being born again of the water and Spirit, then you are none of his (John 3:3-8; Rom. 8:9).</p><h2>Looking for a Heavenly City</h2><p>As we draw to a conclusion, we need to see the climax to the Gospel According to Abraham. What hope did Abraham have? What was it that he looked forward to? Surely it wasn’t just traversing through the dry deserts of the Ancient Near East. Bound up with the promises that Abraham would be a father of many nations, but he would inherit a land. Once Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees he never wanted to go back, and didn’t want his offspring to go back (Gen. 24:8).</p><p>The writer of Hebrews says that Abraham was looking for a better place (Heb. 11:8-16). The desert land was not the place that Abraham ultimately hoped for. Though it would be a land that flowed with milk and honey, Canaan would not be place where Abraham would live eternally.</p><p>Brother and sisters, this world is not our home. This is not all we are living and hoping for. We may have nice things here, and enjoy the pleasures of this world. But they will eventually rust and perish. Together, with Abraham, we look for a better country, whose builder and maker is God. The heavenly city, our eternal home is populated with those who have walked in faith before us (Heb. 12:1).</p><p>Tears will be dried. Sickness will be eradicated. Death will be shut out. Mourning will cease. Pain will be abolished. The City of the Lamb of God is a better city that we look to (Rev. 21:1-27).</p><p>Abraham looked with eyes of eternity and seen a better Savior, a better sacrifice, a better salvation, a great sign of identification, and an eternal land with God’s presence. Abraham walked and lived the gospel of Jesus Christ in faith. Today, if you will believe and obey like Abraham, you can live out the gospel according to Abraham.</p>	100	\N	The Gospel According to Abraham	\N	/AbrahamCaravaggio.jpg
652	2018-07-29 01:15:31	\N	\N	\N	<p>An empire is a group of nations or peoples ruled by an emperor, empress, or other powerful sovereign or government. What if I were to tell you that you were being ruled and governed by a power that you did not elect or choose? Forget for a moment the current government in power wherever you may reside. That is inconsequential at the moment. For there is a power you are currently being subjected to. An empire reigns in your life, and you will be subservient to it. It is my intention to reveal to you the Reign of Empires.</p><h2>The Empire of Sin</h2><blockquote><p>“That as sin hath <strong>reigned</strong> unto death” (Rom. 5:21)</p></blockquote><p>We find man’s plight beginning in Genesis, the book of origins. Here we are introduced to Adam, the first man. Created from the dust of the ground, God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life (Gen. 2:7). Next, man is given authority to be the sovereign over creation (Gen. 1:28-30). As the federal head of creation, Adam was given the responsibility to oversee this God-given empire. However, Adam and his wife, Eve, relinquished their power when they succumbed to the temptation of the serpent in the garden. Adam and Eve failed to believe in the sufficiency of God’s Word and commands (Gen. 3:1-2). The serpent vanquished the kingdom from Adam’s reign as he usurped Adam’s authority.</p><p>Instead of Adam having dominion over the earth, he would now be subservient to another ruler &#8211; sin. By this abdication, sin came into the world through this one man (Rom. 5:12). One trespass led to condemnation to all men, and by one man’s disobedience, the many were made sinners (Rom. 5:18). Sin began its tyrannical rule with Adam’s disobedience. Man became subjugated to sinful desires and temptations.</p><p>This wasn’t how it was designed. Man was made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26). As God’s image-bearer, man had been given dominion. Now, his authority was relinquished and he became a bondman to sin.</p><p>Sin’s Empire is built upon lies. The law by which sin rules is to deceive its captives. This empire questions God’s commands and lures you to do the opposite. Sin’s empire is built with imaginary scenery offering you life’s pleasures and indulgences. Its provinces and terrains are depicted as paradise, but it is only disguising its hell. Its grand allurements are delightful to the eye, giving the impression of wisdom and riches (Gen. 2:6). The appeal is that you can be your own king and queen and do whatever you please answering to no one. Here in this evil empire is the lie that you can be like God, and that God is keeping you from satisfaction (Gen. 3:5).</p><p>Sin’s Empire looks attractive and appealing. Your eyes and affections are captivated by its enticements. But you fail to recognize that the salesman is a serpent. Once you take a bite of the fruit that he offers, your eyes are opened (Gen. 3:7). The fruit hasn’t even reached your digestive system and you realize you have been seduced. The seduction has become your master, and the sounds of chains and shackles have become the constant white noise in your conscience.</p><p>Sin’s economy is to make you believe that everything is free. Deception is its currency. Lies like, “You can take what you want and do what you want without a price.&#8221; Sin’s entrapments cost you all. Sin offers you wealth and you lose everything that you once had. Sin offers you lust, and you lose your purity. Sin offers you status and yet it takes your reputation. Sin offers you freedom and yet you are enslaved.</p><p>The empire of sin’s economy is booming. Because sin will always have its merchants, and it never gives what it promises. How can sin always come out ahead with such obvious fraud? Because it’s patrons are not free, they are enslaved.</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself that you are not under the reign of sin. But Jesus says whoever sins, is a slave to sin (John 8:34). There are no citizens in Sin’s Empire, only slaves, and captives. You may believe that you have not sinned but you are deceiving yourself only making yourself a liar (1 John 1:8). All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). You may not have sinned exactly like Adam, but sin and death reign over you because you were in Adam when he sinned. The condemnation of Sin’s Empire has come upon all men (Rom. 5:14-21).</p><h2>The Empire of Death</h2><blockquote><p>“Nevertheless death <strong>reigned</strong> from Adam to Moses” (Rom. 5:14a)</p></blockquote><p>The Empire of Sin has a neighboring kingdom known as the Empire of Death. Sin has reigned in death. The Empire of Death resides in the dark shadows of Sin’s Empire. Sin doesn’t want to show you this part of its domain. This is the dark part of Sin’s realm that is littered with the graves of sin’s victims. People surely would not migrate to Sin’s Empire if they knew this part of its domain. You must realize that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). This was promised to Adam in the paradise of Eden. God said, “The day that you eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall surely die” (Gen. 2:16-17). Adam and Eve didn’t believe God and instead believed the serpent. Once they ate the forbidden fruit death began to work in their soul and body. Death seized them before they realized it.</p><p>You are currently racing against time, and death is nipping at your heels. It is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27). Death is the inevitable consequence of sin. There is a way that seems right unto man, but its end is death (Pro. 14:12). Death in all of its finality is not the worst part. It will be the second death, the condemnation and judgment of those to an eternal damnation (Rev. 20:14; 21:8).</p><h2>The Empire of Grace</h2><blockquote><p>“even so might grace <strong>reign</strong> through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord” (Rom. 5:21b)</p></blockquote><p>Adam was the first man. Made in the image of God, he was unable to keep God’s commands. His failure led to humanity’s demise. Man fell into the trappings of temptation and sin and death began their awful reign. There seemed to be little hope for humanity to overthrow Sin and Death’s reign.</p><p>Due to Adam’s transgression humanity became an enemy of God. In our weakened condition, and under the power of sin and death we had no hope (Rom. 5:6-10). It would take the Second Adam, Jesus Christ, to liberate humanity (1 Cor. 15:22; 47). It would take the unmerited favor of God to reverse our contentious relationship with God.</p><p>A new empire was on the horizon with the coming of Jesus Christ. Jesus was the Word of God made flesh. The word that was rejected in Eden was going to become flesh and dwell among His creation. He was the glory of God full of grace and truth (John 1:14). Adam failed to obey and trust God’s Word and succumbed to the temptations of the serpent in the garden. Jesus would conquer the temptations of the devil using the Word of God (Matt. 4:1-11). Jesus would accomplish what Adam and humanity couldn’t.</p><p>The only way for humanity to be free from the Empires of Sin and Death was not going to be through the Law of Moses, or through the work and effort of humanity. Rather, grace would be freely given. God showed His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. While we were sinners, Jesus would take the condemnation of death for us, to give us what we didn’t deserve.</p><p>This is the Empire of Grace. Grace reigns through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Consequently, the free gift of Jesus Christ is not like the trespass of Adam. For if many died through one man’s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many (Rom. 5:15). If death reigned through Adam, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:17).</p><h2>The Empire of Jesus</h2><blockquote><p>“much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall <strong>reign</strong> in life by one, Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:17b)</p></blockquote><p>Whereas the captives of Sin and Death’s Empire are in bondage, the citizens of Jesus’ Empire reign in life through Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:17). Sin and Death’s Empire brings condemnation, judgment, and death. On the other hand, Jesus brings reconciliation, justification, righteousness, and life.</p><p>Adam was made from the earth, but Jesus, the Second Adam, came from heaven (1 Cor. 15:47). The first Adam was king over the first creation. While Jesus is the King-Priest over the New Creation (Gen. 1:26-27; 2 Cor. 5:17). Adam’s disobedience brought sin, death, condemnation, and judgment. However, Jesus’ life brings the free gift of reconciliation between God and men, justification, sanctification, and righteousness. Death reigned as emperor because of Adam, but believers reign in abundant life (presently and in the future) through Jesus Christ. Adam’s sin plunged humanity into condemnation and made us enemies of God. Christ’s death brings right standing with God. Adam hid from God because of his trespass, now we have free access to God in Christ. Adam disobeyed God and made us sinners. Christ obeyed, and now through faith, we are made righteous. The Law wasn’t given to save humanity, but to reveal humanity’s sinfulness. The abounding grace of God met the demands of the Law when Jesus Christ died and supplied what the Law couldn’t- salvation from sin.</p><p>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when He delivers the Kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death (1 Cor. 15:20-26).</p><p>Let me ask you, which empire do you want to reign in your life? Will you continue to be enslaved to the reign of sin and death? Or will you choose to believe in Jesus Christ and be free from your sin? If you will have the Son of God, then you will be free indeed (Jn. 8:35-37). And if you will believe in the Son of God, repent of the sins in your heart, be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and receive the free gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38), you will have a new Empire that will reign in your life. It is the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. No longer subject to sin and death, you will be free from the condemnation and judgment (Rom. 8:1-2).</p>	100	\N	The Reign of the Empires	\N	/cederic-vandenberghe-494198-unsplash.jpg

657	2018-06-25 14:48:12	\N	\N	\N	<p>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people. &#8211; Nehemiah 13:23-24</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>A few months ago a book was recommended in a digital periodical that I subscribe to. Most of the time the books that are reviewed are over my head. However, one book caught my attention. The book was titled “<em>Endangered Languages</em>” by Sarah Thomason. Sarah H. Thomason is the William J. Gedney Collegiate Professor of Linguistics in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan. As far as I know she is not a Christian, and this book was not written with Christians in mind. However, I sat captivated and convicted as I read her book on languages.</p><p>Thomason notes that the world’s seven billion people speak about seven thousand languages today. No one knows how many languages have existed over the entire history of humankind, but the number is certainly far higher than seven thousand.</p><p>According to most experts’ estimates, at least half of the world’s seven thousand languages will vanish before the end of this century. There are currently 3,220 endangered languages, 635 extinct or dormant languages, and 100 extinct language families – families of related languages that have all vanished. And a language dies – becomes dormant – every three months or so.</p><p>Despite the increasing attention given to endangered species and the environment, there has been little awareness that peoples can also be endangered. More has been said about the plight of pandas, tigers and spotted owls than about the disappearance of human language diversity.</p><p>Language has played a major role in what has made everything possible for us as a species: our cultures, our technology, our art, music, and much more. Language is the vehicle that produces the culture, traditions and customs that make up a community of people. Without language this is all lost. The loss of the language would mean a loss of the culture, traditions and more importantly the people.</p><h2>The Language of Pentecost</h2><p>Over two thousand years ago a language was birthed in a Near East upper room. It came on the heels of the teaching of Jesus Christ. The language of Pentecost was birthed on the day of Pentecost. The language of Pentecost is made up of the vocabulary of the Apostle’s doctrine.</p><p>For over two thousand years a language has been spoken that is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone. Our vocabulary is made up of words and phrases such as:</p><ul><li> Hear! O Israel the Lord our God is One Lord (Deut. 6:4)</li></ul><ul><li> One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all (Eph. 4:5-6)</li></ul><ul><li> One mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 2:5)</li></ul><ul><li> For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9)</li></ul><ul><li> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. (John 1:1-3,14)</li></ul><ul><li> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: And the government shall be upon his shoulder: And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isa. 9:6)</li></ul><ul><li> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. (Acts 2:38)</li></ul><p>It is vastly important that the language of Pentecost does not become endangered or extinct. The most precious thing we can own is the truth of God’s Word, and we must not allow it to become susceptible to endangerment. Our Apostolic culture, traditions, and customs are built upon the language of Pentecost. Our apostolic doctrine and lifestyle will become susceptible to endangerment if we forget our to speak our language.</p><h2>The Language of Judah</h2><blockquote><p>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people (<strong>Nehemiah 13:23-24</strong>)</p></blockquote><p>Israel and Judah had been removed from the Promised Land due to their apostasy. Idolatry and mixing with the other nations had brought about their ruin. Ezra and a remnant of Israel had returned to Jerusalem with the intent of building the temple and restoring worship. Nehemiah had been sent back to Jerusalem with the intention of rebuilding the walls that Babylon had torn down. Ezra and Zerubbabel restored worship, but Nehemiah’s leadership would not only rebuild the walls but rebuild the identity of the Israelites. Israel needed pure worship restored and the identity of being God’s called out people. After the walls had been built and there had been some improvement with Israel’s spirituality, Nehemiah noticed something very strange:</p><blockquote><p>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people (<strong>Neh. 13:24</strong>)</p></blockquote><p>The people of Israel had married themselves to foreign peoples such as Ashdod, Ammonites, and Moabites. The Israelites were not to marry or mix with heathen people. But that wasn’t the only problem. Nehemiah noticed a change in the language.</p><p>Nehemiah observed it first in the speech of the children. What caught Nehemiah’s attention was that the children were not able to speak the language of Judah. They couldn’t speak the Hebrew language, instead they spoke the languages of Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.</p><p>The people of Ashdod were a mongrel people. The Ammonites and Moabites worshiped Molech and Chemosh who worshiped their respective gods by sacrificing their children in fire. Ammon and Moab were the incestuous offspring of Lot and his daughters.</p><p>There is more than just nationalistic pride at stake with Nehemiah and Israel. What’s at stake is the Scripture. Holy Scripture is in the language of Judah, which was written in Hebrew. They needed to speak the Hebrew language in order to read and obey the Scripture. If the children couldn&#8217;t speak Hebrew, then they certainly wouldn&#8217;t be able to read and understand the Law and Prophets.</p><p>Likewise, the Israelites were to be separate. But the compromise of their separation was identified by their speech. What they spoke was an indicator of their lack of separation.</p><h1>How Language Becomes Endangered</h1><h2>Last Fluent Speakers are the Elderly</h2><p>Thomason&#8217;s studies show that a language can become endangered <strong>when its last fluent speakers are the elderly</strong>. When few or no children are learning it as a first or second language. This is called “<strong><em>moribund</em></strong>”- <strong>A language that is not being transmitted to younger generations</strong>. A language that is not being transmitted to younger generations cannot outlive the last generation of native speakers. This has been the fate of many languages.</p><p>Thomason gives six steps of language endangerment.</p><p><strong><em>1. Safe- When the language is spoken by many generations.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2. Vulnerable- Most speak the language but is restricted to certain environments</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>3. Definitely Endangered- Children no longer learn the language as a mother tongue in home.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>4. Severely Endangered- Language is spoken by grandparents and older generations only.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>5. Critically Endangered- Youngest generation is the older generation but only spoken infrequently.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>6. Extinct- No speakers left.</em></strong></p><p>Brothers and sisters we need to learn and speak the language of Pentecost! Parents we need to be teaching our children the vocabulary of Apostolic Doctrine. We are commanded in Scripture to instruct and teach our children doctrine:</p><blockquote><p> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates (<strong>Deuteronomy 6:6–9</strong>)</p></blockquote><p>Thomason concludes that speaker age is a more reliable indicator of endangerment. The more young speakers there are-the more young speakers/children who are learning the language- the less likely the language is to disappear any time soon. The more consistently we speak the language of Pentecost to our children the more likely they are to speak it for themselves!</p><p>In the end stages of a slow decline that leads to endangerment and disappearance, <strong><em>children no longer learn their heritage language as a first language</em></strong>, so that the number of fluent speakers shrinks over the next few generations until none are left.</p><h2>Shifting to Another Speech Community</h2><p>Next, Thomason says a <strong><em>shift to another speech community</em></strong> will endanger a language. The usual route to language endangerment and death is a shift to speak another language by another speech community.</p><p>The Israelites had began to mix themselves with the surrounding peoples and nations. The Ammonites, Moabites and the people of Ashdod had infiltrated Jerusalem with through intermarriage. Ezra was sent back to build the Temple, and Nehemiah was sent back to rebuild the walls. <strong><em>The walls couldn’t keep out what was in the heart of the people</em></strong>. The Israelite’s identity was vanishing and the main indicator was the type of language the children were speaking.</p><p>Young people, you do not need to speak the language of the world. We have too many Apostolic students who can speak Madden Mobile, Fortnite, Snapchat, Twitter, and can quote the gods of entertainment. However, they can’t speak the language of Pentecost. They leave the doctrine to adults and preachers.</p><p>When two speech communities come into contact and interact regularly, there are likely to be consequences for one or both languages. In particular, the more intense the contact is, the more likely people are to become bilingual; and while bilingualism is by no means a predictor of the future loss of a community’s heritage language, it is often a first step in that direction.</p><p>Thomason says that endangerment occurs through “<strong><em>death by borrowing</em></strong>”, in which a language’s lexicon and structures are swapped by borrowed words and structures from a dominant language.</p><p>Students you don’t need to date someone outside of the faith. They do not speak the same language as you do. Mixing languages, lifestyles and cultures will only lead to a watering down of the original language. Borrowing from the culture to speak to the culture will only dilute and water-down the original language.</p><blockquote><p> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you (<strong>2 Corinthians 6:15-17</strong>)</p><p>Can two walk together, except they be agreed (<strong>Amos 3:3</strong>)?</p></blockquote><h2>The Attitude Towards the Language.</h2><p>Next, what people think about their language – its value, its usefulness, its importance to their culture – can play a decisive role in the language’s fate.<strong><em> If a language is on the brink of endangerment or extinction, its speakers’ opinions about it may speed, hinder, or even reverse its decline</em>.</strong></p><p>Professor Thomason does believe what others think about your language can endanger it, but it is the speaker’s opinion of their language that can lead to its extinction. <strong><em>If you are ashamed of what you believe, then you will not speak it. If you are embarrassed by your heritage then you will not speak it.</em></strong></p><p>No language dies for linguistic reasons; language death is always caused by social factors in the broadest sense. We cannot afford to be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><blockquote><p> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (<strong>Romans 1:16</strong>)</p></blockquote><p>You need to love the truth. Our language must be inundated with truth and love. However, that begins with loving truth:</p><blockquote><p> And with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved (<strong>2 Thessalonians 2:10).</strong></p><p>Buy the truth, and sell it not (<strong>Proverbs 23:23</strong>).</p></blockquote><h2>How to Revitalize a Language</h2><p>Thomason gives three ways in which a language can be revitalized:</p><p><strong>1. It begins with children</strong>. The language of Pentecost and the Apostolic Doctrine has to be in the heart of our students. Doctrine should not be relegated to conferences, camps and church services. This needs to be spoken in your homes, with your friends and in your heart.</p><p><strong>2. Students must be encouraged to use it in their digital lives</strong>. Doctrine needs to be the basis for your social media posts. God does not need a password to see your social media posts. You may can block your pastor but you can’t block Jesus.</p><p><strong>3. Institutions and schooling is not enough</strong>. Only through speaking the language publicly and privately will a language sustain life. But that is not enough either. The language must be transmitted to others for it to be safe from extinction.</p><p>A language that is spoken by community members of all ages, that is learned by all of the community’s children as a first language, and that is spoken in all domains of everyday life – at home, at work, in the schools, and elsewhere – is not endangered.</p><blockquote><p>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen (<strong>Matthew 28:19–20</strong>)</p></blockquote><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>• On 21 January 2008, Marie Smith Jones died in her sleep at her home in Anchorage, Alaska. Smith Jones was the last full-blooded Eyak and the last fluent native speaker of the Eyak language, which was indigenous to Alaska. For the last fifteen years of her life she was the only fluent Eyak speaker. The Eyak language has no offspring &#8211; no close relatives of any kind. The Eyak language will only enjoy being studied in universities, but not spoken. PRESERVED BUT NEVER SPOKEN.</p><p>• A few years ago, linguists raced to the Turkish farm village of Haci Osman to record Tefvik Esenc, a frail farmer believed to be the last known speaker of the Ubykh language once spoken in the northwestern Caucasus. At that time only four or five elder tribesmen remembered some phrases of the language, but only Esenc knew it fluently. Even his own three sons were unable to converse with their father in his native language because they had become Turkish speakers. In 1984 Esenc had already written the inscription he wanted on his gravestone: “<strong><em>This is the grave of Tefvik Esenc. He was the last person able to speak the language they called Ubykh</em></strong>.”</p><p>• In another part of the world on the Isle of Man, Ned Maddrell passed away in 1974. With his death, the ancient Manx language left the community of the world’s living tongues. Just a hundred years earlier, not long before his birth, 12,000 people (nearly a third of the island’s population) still spoke Manx, but when Maddrell died, he was the only fluent speaker left.</p><p>• In South Carolina a native American named Red Thundercloud died, the last voice of a dying tongue. <strong><em>No longer able to converse in his native language with the remaining members of his community, he took the language of his tribe to the grave with him.</em></strong></p><p>Finally, Thomason writes about &#8220;<strong><em>rememberers</em></strong>&#8221; – community members who can provide some words and phrases of the dying language, but who cannot use it in conversation. If the consultants have not used their language at all for decades, the need for retrieving old memories will be even more acute – in this case the consultants may be &#8220;rememberers&#8221;. If there are no remaining almost-fluent speakers, the linguist must glean whatever information is available from people whose knowledge of the language is entirely passive, not active.</p><p>Let us keeping speaking and transmitting the language of Pentecost and the Apostolic doctrine. We should teach our children the Scriptures. We should be consistently sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with the world. The church cannot afford to be satisfied with our &#8220;four and no more.&#8221; The Apostolic church is a movement, not a memorial. Our churches are not to be a museum of what used to be, rather it should be a shining example and extension of what began on the day of Pentecost.</p><p>The tombstones of some Christian denominations should be a grave reminder that compromise and forgetfulness are deadly. The Apostolic church has a responsibility to stay on the old paths, but those old paths need new feet.</p>	100	\N	Endangered Languages	\N	/img_1663.jpg

659	2018-06-19 13:55:14	\N	\N	\N	<p>Romans 4:11–17</p><p>Since YouTube’s inception on the World Wide Web , it has evolved from a website for funny videos clips, to television series. Perhaps one of the most interesting, and helpful things about YouTube is its ability to help people learn how to do just about anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a third of American children are living in fatherless homes, and some sociologists have even declared to say that the absence of a father in a child&#8217;s life is one of the greatest social problems facing the United States. Certainly it would be absurd to consider YouTube as an adequate alternative to an actual father-figure. But, many fatherless children turn to YouTube to learn how to do many tasks. Some will turn to YouTube to learn how to change a tire, how to tie a tie, and how to balance a checkbook.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>However, YouTube will never be there to pat you on the back or give you a hug. YouTube will never be there to straighten your tie, or tighten your oil filter. YouTube will not be there to pray for you, or shepherd you. You may be able to watch millions of videos about faith and God, but it will not replace the influence of a father of faith.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Such statements do not mean that a mother doesn’t have the ability to spiritually shape and mold a child. I can attest that I did not have a father of faith, but I did have a mother of faith. I have had fathers in the faith, and still do, who have had more influence on me than my father did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Biological fathers have a responsibility to be more than just a male figure in the home. They have the spiritual responsibility to live a life of faith. Your wives and children are relying on you to impart your spiritual influence. Fathers are to exemplify faith to their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h2>Abraham the Father of Faith</h2><p>To help the church in Rome understand the foundation of faith as a means for salvation, Paul uses Abraham has the ultimate example. Abraham’s faith in God was counted as righteousness (Rom. 4:11). Abraham was Paul’s example because the promises given to Abraham preceded the command for circumcision, which the Jews held as validation for their claims as spiritual offspring, and recipients of God’s promises and salvation. Paul wanted the Gentiles and Jews to know that Abraham’s faith was for all, not just the circumcised.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>We are first introduced to Abraham in Genesis twelve, with the record of God calling Abraham to believe and to be the recipient of God’s promises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed (Genesis 12:1–3)</p><h3>God tells Abraham to:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h3><ul><li>Go from your country (Gen. 12:1a)</li><li>Go from your family (Gen. 12:1a)</li><li>Go from your father’s house (Gen. 12:b)</li></ul><h3>With the promises:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h3><ul><li>I will make of you a great nation</li><li>I will bless you</li><li>I will make your name great</li><li>You will be a blessing</li><li>Bless those who bless you</li><li>Curse those who curse you</li><li>All families on the earth will be blessed because of you</li></ul><p>Abraham became a father of faith because he was willing to believe God. If we are going to follow in the steps of our father Abraham, then we should consider his choices and lifestyle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h2>I. Abraham Lived Set Apart</h2><p>Abraham lived in Ur of Chaldees. This was an important place for moon worship. Abraham was an idolator and the son of an idolator (Josh. 24:2-3). Though he was from the long line of Noah and Shem, somewhere in his family history men no longer worshiped the True God, and instead worshiped idols.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As we read in Genesis twelve there isn’t an introduction given between Abraham and Jehovah. However, it is God who initiates the call of Abraham. There wasn’t anything inherently good about Abraham that provoked God to call Abraham. Instead, it was God’s grace that initiated the call of Abraham.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The conditions of God’s promises were for Abraham to leave his country, his family, and his father’s house (Gen. 12:1-3). This was no easy undertaking for Abraham. Everything that was familiar was to be forsaken, and Abraham was to become a pilgrim without a home (Heb. 11:9). But if Abraham was going to be a father of faith, he would have to leave the cultural norms and societal tolerances to find godly purpose. Abraham couldn’t be a father of faith in Ur. Old lifestyles and mindsets would have to be left in Ur. All that Abraham had known paled in comparison to what God Almighty was willing to give him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h3>a. Abraham had to leave the old ways</h3><p>Men, just because you had an idolatrous father, or family doesn’t mean you have to be. You can break from the generational habits and shortcomings that plague your family history. If you will hear God’s call, you can forsake the cycles that harm relationships, and ruin futures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Too many men feel as if they have to behave and live as their fathers and grandfathers did. If they were ornery, cruel and mean that means they have to do the same. Men, God is calling us to break the habits and pitfalls of sin, and worldliness to be separate (2 Cor. 6:17). Abraham was doomed to live as Terah did, had it not been for God’s grace and call. You don’t have the power to change yourself. There aren&#8217;t enough self-help books that you can read and inspirational seminars for you to attend to break the bonds of sin, and generational failures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h3>b. Abraham had to leave family</h3><p>Abraham was going to have to leave his family behind in order to possess God’s promises. This was not a dishonoring or disrespecting of family. Rather, this was about leaving the comforts of familiarity, and the dependence upon family. Abraham was going to follow God by faith, and depend on God’s providence to take care of him and his family. But have no doubt that there will be those in your family who will challenge your faith. Many have had to make the difficult decision to leave family creeds and traditions to obey God’s word. They would not be bound to cultural dogmas and domestic religions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Some families would rather their children be drunkards and drug addicts rather than Christians. They’d rather their family members disobey Scripture than leave traditions. But if you’re going follow Jesus Christ and be considered His child, then you may have to forsake family trees to embrace Calvary’s tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Abraham’s family was wealthy. Abraham was leaving an inheritance in Ur of Chaldees. He was leaving the family business for the the Father’s business. He was leaving fortunes, to become a pilgrim without a home. But Abraham caught a glimpse of God’s riches bound up in His promises that far surpassed Ur and Terah. Men, get your eyes off of the riches of this world, and look for heavenly treasures. You may not be wealthy on earth, but your possessions will not be measured by Forbes magazine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h3>c. Abraham had to leave worldliness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h3><p>Abraham had to leave Ur of Chaldees and the idolatrous lifestyle that was prevalent. Ur of Chaldees did not offer what God could. Though Abraham never truly possessed the Promised Land, the promise was far greater than than the present reality in Ur. Despite not having a child yet, Abraham realized Ur of Chaldees wasn’t a place to raise his children. Far too many fathers are willing to let the world raise their children, than allow God, the church, and Scripture to impart the wisdom they need.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Brothers, we are called to be holy. We are called to be separate from the things of this world. We are not isolated from the world, rather we are be insulated from the world. Fathers, if you are going to be a father of faith, or lead your family by faith, then you must be the example of consecration and separation. You mustn’t be acclimated to this world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h2>II. Abraham Lived by Faith and Sacrifice</h2><p>If you look at the story of Abraham there are mountain peaks of achievement and valleys of disappointment. Abraham had to set himself apart from his nephew Lot and allow Lot to experience the consequence of bad choices (Gen. 13,14,19). Abraham built altars and worshiped. He also lied and wilted when he needed to be courageous (Gen. 20). When he should have trusted God, he listened to the doubt of his wife Sarah (Gen. 16). We see Abraham falling flat on his face in failure, yet always soon restored to the path of faith.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Abraham didn’t have angel’s wings, or a glowing halo hovering above his head. Abraham had clay feet, but possessed fervent faith. He faced difficulty and looked frustrations in the eye, and yet had faith planted in his heart. When Sarah was barren and without child, Abraham was pregnant with faith. The dusty terrain of the Ancient East was temporarily marked by the footsteps of faith. Winds blew his path away, but God kept shining a light for Abraham to walk with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>&#8220;Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness&#8221; (Romans 4:18–22).</p><h3>How to be a father of faith:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h3><ul><li>In hope he believed against hope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li><li>He wasn’t weak in faith</li><li>He didn’t stagger with unbelief at God’s promises</li><li>He was strong in faith</li><li>Gave glory to God</li><li>He was fully persuaded in God’s promises</li></ul><p>This could be summed up in one sentence: “<em>The righteous shall live by faith” (Rom. 1:17).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Abraham lived by faith, but he also lived by sacrifice. The dusty footprints of Abraham’s walk of faith was coupled with the altars that he frequently built. Abraham’s faith was united with worship. If Abraham taught anything to Isaac and Ishmael it was faith is nothing without worship. Abraham journeyed the desert with heaven in his heart, but he also carried the tools to build an altar. These were not the altars built to worship the moon. No, Abraham made unsightly altars to worship the God of heaven. Abraham was not worshiping the stars. No, God had promised to give him offspring as numerous as the stars. Such a God was worthy of Abraham’s worship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h2>III. Abraham Lived as an Example</h2><p>Abraham’s faith was lived out before his family. Isaac didn’t need to go somewhere else to learn how to worship God. The greatest example of faith was in the home. Often parents want the church to teach what they should be teaching. They would rather relinquish their influence so others could do what they won’t do. What do we see Isaac doing when he’s grown? Resigning the wells his father had dug, and building his own altars (Gen. 26:17-25). That’s the type of example Abraham lived before Isaac.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Men, we are to be worshipers. Faith is best exemplified with the outward manifestation of worship. Whether that’s lifting your hands, making a joyful noise, or building altars of sacrifice. The best inheritance you can leave your children is the treasure trove of faithful worship. Abraham taught Isaac how to build altars. Abraham taught Isaac how to worship. Abraham taught Isaac how to live by faith and not by sight. Abraham taught his family what faithfulness looked like.</p><p>Chances are that you are worshiping something. It might not be Jesus that you’re worshiping. Your children will know what you worship. Where your treasure is, that’s where your worship will be found. If you worship entertainment, sports, celebrities, wealth, and pleasure, then do not blame the church for your children’s worship of those same gods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>You and I may not have the dramatic calling that Abraham had. But we can walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had (Rom. 4:12). Abraham had many great accomplishments in his life of faith. Possibly, Abraham’s greatest achievement was that the covenant promises that were given by God were confirmed in Isaac and later to Jacob. However, you and I stand here as a testament to a father’s faith. Abraham never could have imagined that his faith would have offspring some six thousand years or more later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Fathers, your faith and example matter today, and it will matter many years from now. You may never possess all that God has for you in this life, but your children, and grandchildren may possess it. But it begins with you, just as it began with Abraham, the father of faith.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>	100	\N	Fathers of Faith	\N

661	2018-04-16 02:20:54	\N	\N	\N	<p>It had been an interesting few days for the Israelites. Jehovah had just liberated them from Egypt’s fetters as His might and power were on display in the plagues and parting of the Red Sea. They traveled to Mount Sinai where Moses, who had led them out of Egypt, would meet with God face to face. The Lord of Hosts was going to give Moses and Israel a plan. Now that they were free from the chains of Egypt, they needed to be free from the bondage of sin. They were out of Egypt, but now they needed to get Egypt out of them. Liberation came with a price and a new lifestyle. Here at Mount Sinai, they would be given the Law. Besides the commandments written on tablets of stone, Jehovah gave Moses a divine plan. God was going to dwell among His chosen people.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst. Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it&#8221; (Exodus 25:8–9).</p></blockquote><p>The Tabernacle in the wilderness would serve as a type and shadow of heavenly realities.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, &#8216;See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain'&#8221;(Hebrews 8:5).</p></blockquote><p>If God was going dwell in the midst of His people, then there needed to be a blueprint. The world has never seen a more perfect structure than the Tabernacle, for God was the Divine architect. Every detail was given attention and was baptized with meaning. This was the blueprint, and it was to be followed correctly. This transportable sacred structure would only be stationary at particular points in the wilderness. When they would set up the Tabernacle it would dwell at the center-most part of the camp with each tribe strategically situated. The presence of God was to be the center of the Israelite’s life as they wandered the wilderness.</p><p>Much could be written about the Tabernacle in the wilderness for it is teeming with spiritual significance. It should be noted that we have only two chapters in Scripture concerning the creation, but we have close to fifty chapters concerning the tabernacle. God would rather us be more attentive to His dwelling among His people.</p><h2>The Perfect Pattern</h2><p>When the Lord began to give Moses the pattern for the Tabernacle He began with the interior and worked his way out. The blueprint started in the Holy of Holies with the Ark of the Covenant and worked inside to outside. So it is with the Christian. Salvation begins in the inner man at the heart, then sanctification works inside out. For our brief survey, we are going to work through the Tabernacle as it would be approached.</p><p>Located in the courtyard and within the Tabernacle structure would be objects and furnishings which would serve in the worship of the inhabiting presence of Jehovah. Each item would serve a particular function.</p><ul><li>The Brazen Altar</li><li>The Laver</li><li>The Table of Showbread</li><li>The Golden Lamp Stand</li><li>The Altar of Incense</li><li>The Ark of the Covenant and Mercy Seat</li></ul><h2>The Altar</h2><p>The Tabernacle was surrounded by linen curtains serving as a fence. The purpose of this fence was to keep man out. The curtains stood seven and a half feet tall, bystanders could not casually see what was happening in the courts of the Tabernacle, they would have to come in. Anyone could come, but you must enter by the one entrance. One could not jump over the fence, or slide under the fence. No, there was only one entrance. The one entrance was embroidered with blue, scarlet, and purple needlework (Ex. 38:18).</p><p>Once you entered the door and entered the court of the Tabernacle you were met by the Brazen Altar. The Altar for burnt offerings stood just inside the door. It was the shape of a square, measuring seven and a half feet long and wide and four and a half feet high. It was large and could support the sacrifice of lambs, bulls, and oxen. This was the largest piece of equipment. Built of wood and overlaid with brass, here the sacrifice was slain and burned. However, no man started the fire, the fire was kindled from heaven, and it was to never go out (Lev. 6:12-13; 9:24). Salvation is of the Lord, and His fire never goes out!</p><h2>The Laver</h2><p>The Laver was made of solid brass and was to be filled with pure water (Ex. 30:17-21; 38:8). The priests would wash their hands and feet after stopping at the Altar. The Laver is representative of our washing and cleansing. This can only come after the burnt offering. To be born again and to be washed in pure water for the remission of our sins can only come after spiritual death at repentance (John 3:3-9).</p><p>One should note that the size of the Laver is never mentioned, whereas all the other dimensions and details for all other furnishings are given. But the size of the Laver is not given perhaps because any and all can be washed. <strong>The Altar was large enough to kill the sacrifice, but the Laver was large enough to cleanse the vilest of sinners</strong>. It was limitless in its function. With no floor in the Tabernacle or in the court, the priest’s feet were in constant contact with the ground. Oh, for a washing and a cleansing! There must be a continual washing for the Christian. Sins could be forgiven, but the defilement of the world needs remission. To be made new, and washed clean!</p><h2>The Table of Showbread</h2><p>Once you are washed at the laver you entered the Holy Place. The sacrifice has been accepted, the water has washed away the defilements, and you can now enter fellowship.</p><p>Three pieces of furniture were in the Holy Place:</p><ul><li>the table of showbread</li><li>the golden lampstand</li><li>the altar of incense</li></ul><p>On the north side of the Holy Place was the table of showbread. The table was made of acacia wood and overlaid with pure gold. The table’s dimensions were three feet long and one and a half feet wide and two and a quarter feet high (Ex. 25:23-24). The table also had parts to which it could be easily transported, and it included its utensils (Ex. 25:24-29). Each week there would be twelve pieces of bread placed on the table. Two stacks of six loaves. The bread was not food for God, like some pagan god. Rather, this represented God’s people being physically sustained by Jehovah. This bread was to be eaten by the priests. The bread was representative of the Word of God to be eaten and digested.</p><h2>The Golden Lamp Stand</h2><p>Across from the table of showbread was the Golden Lamp Stand or Candlestick (Ex. 25:31-40). It was made of beaten pure gold. There were seven branches, three standing on each side and one in the middle. In the outer court of the Tabernacle, the light would be provided by the sun. However, in the Holy Place, the light illuminated from the golden candlestick. There were no windows, or electricity, only the candlestick. The oil provided the light, which was made of pure beaten olive oil. The fresh oil from the unripened olives would give a smokeless light. The people would provide the oil for the illumination in the Holy Place. The bread was eaten under the illumination of the oil sustained candlestick.</p><h2>The Altar of Incense</h2><p>Standing in front of the veil of the Holy of Holies was the Altar of Incense. The Golden Candlestick is glowing, the bread has been eaten and now the High Priest draws near to the Altar of Incense. Before he can go into the holiest place he must come to the place of prayer. It was made of wood and overlaid with pure gold. It stood three feet high and one half feet square. It sat at the central position in the Holy Place, between the Table of Showbread and the Golden Candlestick. Every morning Aaron the High Priest was to burn incense upon it.</p><p>Prayer is necessary for fellowship with God.<strong> We partake of His Word, our hearts and minds are illuminated by His guiding light, and we commune with Him in prayer.</strong> Here at the altar of incense, we send up our supplications and intercessions. It is a sweet smelling aroma unto the Lord.</p><h2>The Holy of Holies</h2><p>Now the priest enters the Holy of Holies through the veil which is directly behind the altar of incense. Here, in the most holy place, stood the Ark of the Covenant and Mercy Seat. This was the most important piece of the Tabernacle. The Holy of Holies was fifteen feet high, wide and long. It was separated from the Holy Place by a heavy curtain or veil.</p><p>The Ark of the Covenant was three and three-fourths feet long, two and one-fourth feet wide, and two and one-fourth feet high. It was made of wood, covered with gold. The Ark contained the written law, a pot of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded. Sitting on top of the ark was the golden mercy seat which had two cherubim with their outstretched wings touching.</p><p>The Ark was a symbol of God’s throne. On the Day of Atonement, the High Priest would enter this last room and sprinkle blood on the Mercy Seat from the slain sacrifice. The broken law, which was housed in the Ark, needed a mercy seat and shed blood to cover it. But it was here, at the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, that the Shekinah Glory of God would hover. The glory of God would dwell where the shed blood of redemption was applied. The broken law is covered by mercy and blood. The Spirit of God would not dwell where the blood wasn’t applied.</p><p>Once the Tabernacle was completed and erected the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Ex. 40:34-35). Moses was unable to enter in the Tabernacle due to the Spirit of God richly dwelling there.</p><h2>The Tabernacle of God in John&#8217;s Gospel</h2><p>Now, we must understand the significance of the Tabernacle in the New Testament. The writer of Hebrews stated that the Tabernacle was a shadow and copy of heavenly realities. But the Tabernacle in the Wilderness was only temporary. It could not and would not last forever, and it would begin to deteriorate with time and the elements. The sacrifices proved to be insufficient for man’s sins. At the Tabernacle, God would only be at one location on earth, though His Spirit is omnipresent. If God was going to dwell among His people, then another tabernacle was needed.</p><p>John’s Gospel is significant, for he pens his opening declaring that Jesus Christ is the Word of God dwelling among us (Jn. 1:1-3, 14). He uses the phrase <strong>“dwelt among us”</strong> to describe the Living Word of God as coming to earth. The word dwelt in the original language means to <strong>“pitch a tent.”</strong></p><p>The tabernacle was the dwelling-place of Jehovah; the meeting-place of God and Israel. So the Word came to men in the person of Jesus. As Jehovah adopted for His habitation a dwelling like that of the people in the wilderness, so the Word assumed a community of nature with mankind, an embodiment like that of humanity at large, and became flesh.</p><p>There is also a captivating parallel between the structure of John’s Gospel and the Tabernacle of the Old Testament.</p><p>The Tabernacle in the Wilderness was in three parts: <strong>The courtyard, the holy place, and the holy of holies</strong>. But it should be noted that it was only one Tabernacle. There may have been three different areas of that one Tabernacle, but it was still one Tabernacle. The Ark of the Covenant which stood in the holy of holies was wood covered in gold on both the inside and outside. Three parts &#8211; gold (divine), wood (humanity), gold (divine). Again, only one Ark of the Covenant. The Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant are a shadow of heavenly things, but represent Jesus Christ in reality. Jesus was Tabernacled among us. Not many could understand that Jesus was the embodiment of God the Father. He was Father (divine), Son (humanity), and Spirit (divine).</p><p>The Tabernacle in the Wilderness was furnished with seven significant pieces, all of which pointed to Jesus Christ. When we come to John’s Gospel we find those same seven furnishings in the exact same order. Whether or not John purposed this or not, or whether He was divinely inspired to categorize these things in this way is not certain. However, we should note that everything was done according to patter (Heb. 8:5).</p><h2>The Altar</h2><p>John begins by saying that Jesus Christ was <strong>“tabernacled”</strong> among us (Jn. 1:14). But it is John the Baptist who points to the Brazen Altar and declares Jesus to be the Lamb of God come to take away the sins of the world (Jn. 1:29). It will be Jesus’ death at Calvary that will bring atonement for the sins of the world. Jesus as the Lamb of God will once and for all end the necessity for sacrifice (Heb 8:13).</p><h2>The Laver</h2><p>Next, in the third chapter of John’s Gospel, we find Jesus taking us to the Laver. When Nicodemus, a learned Jewish rabbi, comes at night to speak with the Lord, Jesus tells him that you must be born again of the water and the Spirit or you cannot see or enter the Kingdom of God (Jn. 3:3-6). You must be washed and sanctified by the water. It is not enough to simply have the Lamb of God on the altar, you must be washed.</p><h2>The Table of Showbread</h2><p>Following the Laver, we find in John chapter four, five, and six that John takes us to the table of showbread. Jesus tells the woman at the well that He is the Living water, of which if a man drinks, he shall never thirst again (Jn. 4:10; 13-14). He speaks to His disciples that His food is to do the will of Him who sent Him (Jn. 5:34). In John five Jesus tells his audience that the Scriptures which give eternal sustenance speak of Him (Jn. 5:39). Then Jesus explains that He is the bread of life, that if a man comes to Him, he will never hunger again (Jn. 6:25). Jesus was the bread come down from heaven, and whoever eats on this bread will live forever (Jn. 6:57-58). Many turned from following Him at this saying, but Peter knew that Jesus was the word of eternal life.</p><h2>The Golden Lamp Stand</h2><p>Next, in John chapter eight John walks us to the Golden Lamp Stand. Jesus plainly declares that He is the Light of the World and that whoever follows Him will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life. In Jesus was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in darkness and darkness will not overcome it (Jn. 1:4-5). Jesus’ light brings sight to the blind, but those who do not believe remain in blind in their darkness (Jn. 9:39-41).</p><h2>The Altar of Incense</h2><p>Then in John chapters fourteen through seventeen, we see Jesus with the eleven disciples teaching them to pray at the Altar of Incense. He teaches them to pray at the golden altar in a way and through a Name unknown before. Before the priest stood at the Altar of Incense offering prayers for Israel. Now, Jesus is showing that prayer in His Name is the way of intercession and supplication. If they would abide in Jesus and in His words, they could ask whatever they desired and it would be done for them (Jn. 15:7). However, now His Name had been manifested and faith in that name brought power to prayers. But in that High Priestly prayer in John seventeen we see Jesus, our High Priest, offering supplications and intercession for His disciples at the Golden Altar of Incense.</p><h2>The Ark of the Covenant and Shekinah Glory</h2><p>Finally, in the climax of Calvary in John eighteen and nineteen, we see the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy Seat. Jesus is the very Ark of the Covenant and its Mercy Seat sprinkled with His own blood. The sins of the world had been atoned for, and the broken Law was now covered with the blood of Jesus Christ. Instead of a broken covenant with God the Father, we have a new covenant through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in which He says, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God, and your God” (Jn. 20:17).</p><p>However, once the blood had sprinkled on the Ark of the Covenant and everything was finished, the glory of God would fill the Tabernacle with the Shekinah Glory. And here, John shows us that it is the gift of the Holy Spirit, that now fills our earthen vessel, “And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, ‘Receive ye the Holy Ghost’” (Jn. 20:22). This is the new Shekinah glory!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the Tabernacle in the Old Testament was only a type and shadow of a heavenly reality. It pointed to a better tabernacle and a better dwelling. God did not want to dwell in a tent made of hands. He was the Word of God tabernacled in flesh. He was the Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world. He was the bread of life and the living water. He was the light shining in the darkness of sin. He has given us a Name that can be used in prayer and supplication. He was the Ark of the Covenant housing the Word of God, the bread of God, and the power of God. And He was the Mercy Seat which brought grace upon grace. However, what could be better than Christ being tabernacled among us? It was expedient that He (which dwelt among us) go away, so He can be in us (Jn. 14:-16-17).</p><p>Behold, the Tabernacle of God!</p>	100	\N	The Tabernacle of God	\N	/Stiftshuette_Modell_Timnapark.jpg

663	2018-03-12 14:00:53	\N	\N	\N	<h2>The Lawyer</h2><p>A certain Jewish lawyer stood up to ask Jesus a question. Perhaps he wanted to know if Jesus really knew the path to eternal life. But putting Jesus to the test, he cleared his throat and asked, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life (Luke 10:25)?” Being that he was offspring of Abraham he, along with other Jews, believed that eternal life could be inherited. The belief was that eternal life was something that could be passed down to him after his death, like inheriting something from another loved one’s death. This Jewish lawyer also held to the idea that he could do something to inherit eternal life. However, you can’t do anything to gain an inheritance, you receive it by birthright. A lawyer of the Torah would certainly know that.</p><p>Like this certain lawyer, there are those who believe they can obtain eternal life because someone in their family is saved. There are also those who believe that they can do something to earn eternal life. Both are wrong. You cannot inherit eternal life like some sort of earthly estate passed on each generation. Rather, Jesus, through His death and resurrection, would give eternal life freely. Jesus was the Guarantor of eternal life to anyone who believed, to the Jew and Gentile alike (Rom. 1:16). Jesus, too, was going to <em>do</em> what no man could do for himself. Man did not have the ability to work or earn salvation (Eph. 2:8-9). Rather, Jesus Christ would purchase salvation and then freely give to those who believe (Rom. 5:15-16).</p><p>Jesus, the embodiment of wisdom, volleyed a question to the lawyer, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it (Lk. 10:26)?” Jesus knew exactly what the Law said, and knew how the lawyer would respond. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself” answered the lawyer (Lk. 10:27). He answered correctly, but Jesus wasn’t through. “Go and do likewise, and you will live” Jesus countered (Lk. 10:28). With a smirk, and sarcastic tone the lawyer asked yet another question: “And who is my neighbor?” He was attempting to justify himself (Lk. 10:29).</p><p>It is with this question that Jesus begins to tell a parable. Jesus answers the question by shrouding truth in symbolism and imagery. But let the reader understand, that Jesus isn’t just describing what a neighbor is, but he is wanting the lawyer to see how broken he is.</p><h2>The Traveler</h2><p>It was a hot sunny day in Jerusalem. Zion sat perched on a hill in Israel, some 2500 feet above sea level. Traveling to Jerusalem you would lift up your head and eyes to see the Temple in its glory. The hills of Jerusalem are considered natural defenses against attacking enemies.</p><p>The psalmist wrote, “<em>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King. Within her citadels, God has made himself known as a fortress</em>” (Psalm 48:1–3).</p><p>Jerusalem, Mount Zion, the dwelling place of Israel’s Sovereign King. High up on the mount sits the Temple, which houses the glory of God. James Montgomery Boice wrote:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>“From the north, west, and east, and even from the immediate south, the way to Zion is uphill, which is why the psalms always speak of going “up” to Jerusalem. There on the lofty hills of Zion, the towering ramparts of the city rose, and the breathtaking beauty of the city beckoned.”</em></p><p>However, there was a man, most likely a Jew, who decided to go down to Jericho. Jericho was a 15-20 mile journey down from Jerusalem. The man was leaving the City of God to head downwards towards Jericho. Jericho was situated next to the Dead Sea about 1300 feet below sea level. This was a drastic change in climate and altitude. However, this man was going to leave the beautiful elevated city of God for lowly Jericho. The trip towards Jericho was a dangerous one. The pathway between Jerusalem and Jericho was riddled with caverns, ravines, cliffs, in addition it was a narrow and curvy road. Not only was the terrain dangerous, but it was infested with unsavory fellows who would scheme, attack and rob unbeknownst travelers. Many called this route “The Bloody Way” or the “Red Way.” Many lives had been hurt and lost on this dreadful route. No doubt this was a formidable choice to leave the safe haven of Jerusalem to campaign to Jericho.</p><p>However, this certain man left Jerusalem to go down to Jericho. Like Samson going down to Timnath (Judges 14:1) and Jonah going to down to Joppa (Jonah 1:3), he went down only to find his ruin. Those who leave the dwelling of God only go downwards. To leave the place where God’s Spirit dwells is to end up lower than before. None go down to find God, but you must travel upwards to Mount Zion to find His presence.</p><p>Our traveler moved downwards toward Jericho where he fell among robbers. The phrase “he fell” in the Greek means to come across or meet a hazardous or negative situation by accident. He didn’t intend to get in this situation, but here he was. Ensnared by a pack of robbers where they stripped him, beat him, and left him half dead (Lk. 10:30).</p><p>As he lay there half-dead was he thinking of those who had warned him of the dangers of traveling down to Jericho? Did regret fill his mind? He is now unable to get back up toward Jerusalem under his own strength. He may not even be able to move. He is in no condition to save himself. He is unclad and broken. The thieves have come to steal, kill and destroy. He has nothing left but anguish and pain. Who will come down to where he is?</p><h2>The Priest</h2><p>Now by chance, a priest was going down that road. This is just what this broken man needed, someone who would have the disposition to help him. A priest was a servant of God by definition. He was one who offered sacrifices for the people’s sins and was considered to be a epitome of spiritual fortitude. Surely this man would show mercy to this discomfited man. The traveler, in expectation and hope, gathered enough strength to lift up his hand in an attempt to get the attention of the priest. However, when the priest saw the naked, half-dead traveler, he passed by on the other side.</p><p>The priest who stood for the rituals of the law, who knew about the sacrifices, was taught concerning mercy and love did not come to where he was. He passed by on the other side. He sidestepped and walked passed the hurting traveler. The traveler had a short-lived hope. He remained in his condition, left for the circling vultures who tarried for his inevitable death.</p><h2>The Levite</h2><p>Inadvertently, a Levite came passing by. A Levite was a member of the Levitical priesthood that assisted the priests. He, too, would have been familiar with the Law and justice. Surely this man would come to where the impaired traveler lay. Instead of stopping to help, the Levite pretended not to notice the man in need. He looked in all other directions and feigned to be distracted by all of the other scenery. Ignoring the traveler’s groaning and cries of despair the Levite hurriedly walks by. The Levites gave a tenth of their spices, mint, dill and cumin. But they neglected the more important matters of the law&#8211;justice, mercy and faithfulness (Matt. 23:23).</p><p>“This is it,” the traveler thought to himself “I am going to die here. No one will come to where I am. This is an awful place to be, and who would want to attempt to help me? They too are afraid of what may happen to them. I am destined to die in this condition.” The vultures that once circled from a distance have come closer to feast on their prey. Another victim of the Bloody Way.</p><h2>The Samaritan</h2><p>But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was (Lk. 10:33). The ears of those listening to Jesus’ story perked up. One listener asked in disbelief, “<em>a Samaritan</em>?” No one liked a Samaritan. They weren’t truly Jewish, and they weren’t truly Gentile. They were a mixed bag of confusion. Samaritans were reviled. Today, when someone uses the phrase “Samaritan” it is one of respect and honor. Hospitals and social agencies proudly proclaim the name “Samaritan.” But in Jesus’ day, such a phrase and a person was considered a devil. Jesus’ detractors declared viciously, “<em>Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a devil</em> (Jn. 8:48)?” With this very parable, Jesus turned Samaritans from being reviled into being respected. Jesus changed the course of the name Samaritan with one simple story. Such is the gospel! Jesus can make that which is detested and make it respected.</p><p>A rejected Samaritan came to where the injured traveler was. All others had passed him by, but the one who was rejected by everyone came to another who was rejected by everyone.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Going over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him.</em><br /><em> The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins, telling him, ‘Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I’ll pay you the next time I’m here.’</em> (Luke 10:34–35 NLT)</p><p>The Samaritan came to the half-dead traveler and had compassion on him. The phrase in the original language meant &#8220;to be moved in the bowels, the heart, the guts of a person; to be moved with great emotion, affection, and pity.&#8221; The Samaritan was brokenhearted for this lifeless man. He bound up his wounds and applied oil and wine to them.</p><p>Olive oil and wine had antiseptic and healing benefits for wounds and abrasions. His treatment did not stop at this point. The Samaritan brought him out of an awful circumstance and took him to a much better one. The Samaritan took the man to an inn and took care of him. When he departed from the inn, he left money with the innkeeper to care for the man and pledged to compensate him when he returned to the inn.</p><p>What the weary, bruised, and wounded traveler could not do for himself, the Samaritan took care of. Others could not and would not help him. The traveler could not help himself. But the Samaritan came to where he was and brought hope, healing, and recovery. The Samaritan brought him to the Inn and paid the price and then some. He came to where He was, but He didn’t leave him how he found him.</p><h2>He Came to Where I Was</h2><p>This Samaritan came where the beaten man was located. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ came from the portals of Glory to a depraved earth to meet our need and to heal our sin-sick souls. Jesus arrived to seek fallen man and save him. Unable to save ourselves, Jesus came to accomplish what we could not.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost</em> (Luke 19:10).</p><p>The Samaritan was despised by the Jewish people. The name &#8220;Samaritan&#8221; was a name given in ridicule to the mixed people who immigrated to Samaria after the deportation of the Israelites to Babylon. This name was never repeated by a Jew except in scorn and hatred. When Christ was on earth, He was hated and despised by men. The Jewish people utterly rejected Him in spite of the proof that He offered that He was the true Messiah.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not</em> (Isaiah 53:3).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>He came unto his own, and his own received him not</em> (John 1:11).</p><p>Like the Samaritans, Jesus too has a name that has been reviled. Multitudes would rather the name of Jesus not be mentioned either in prayer, or in sermons because it might be offensive. However, the name of Jesus is the only name that can bring salvation. That name may be abhorred by others, but it is sweet healing and salvation to those who believe in His Name (John 1:12)!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved</em> (Acts 4:12)</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father</em> (Philippians 2:9-11).</p><p>The Samaritan got involved and had compassion for the fallen man. Our Lord was a man who permeated with compassion. When He was here on earth, He repeatedly demonstrated His love. Jesus was neither intimidated nor afraid to touch the people who needed Him most. His loving-kindness moved him towards the broken.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd</em> (Matthew 9:36).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick</em> (Matthew 14:14).</p><p>The message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a message of Christ&#8217;s love for this world. It was His love that put Him and kept Him on the cross at Calvary.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (</em>John 3:16).</p><p>Jesus was not a Samaritan. However, he was both God and man. He was not half god and half man. Rather, Jesus was the God-Man, who came to earth to bind up the broken from the bloody way of sin. Satan and sin had only come to steal, kill and destroy. Jesus came that we might have life, and have life more abundantly (John 10:10). As lost sinners we were without hope and without the ability to save ourselves. The Law and religion only revealed our brokenness, unable to heal the wounds of sin.</p><p>But Jesus Christ came to where we were!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins. You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil—the commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God. All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just like everyone else. But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much, that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God’s grace that you have been saved!) For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus. So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus. God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago</em> (Ephesians 2:1–10 NLT).</p><p>Jesus Christ, traveled the bloody way to mend the broken, and to heal sin-damaged souls. Humanity was stripped of integrity and left for the vultures. God did not stand aloof, nor did He pass us by. Instead He came to where we were! He became what He wasn’t so we could become what we weren’t. The sinless took on sin that we might be clothed in righteousness (2. Cor. 5:21). He brought us to the Inn and paid the debt of sin we could never repay. He was rejected so we could be accepted. He was reviled so we could be approved. He was stripped that we could be clothed. He was beaten so we could be healed. He died so we could live. He raised to life so we could have new life.</p><p>Mercy comes to where we are, lying on the Bloody Way, beaten and left to die. Grace pours in oil and wine and puts us on His own animal, and takes us to the Inn (the church), where we will be nurtured and reclaim our strength. Mercy comes to where we are, and grace brings salvation.</p><p>When I was lost and dying, He came to where I was.</p>	100	\N	He Came to Where I Was	\N	/diego-jimenez-HNOaMthcq0w-unsplash-scaled.jpg
664	2018-03-01 20:12:04	\N	\N	\N	<p>Language is wonderful and mysterious. Language is a gift of God. To use your mouth and voice to express feelings, emotions, and to communicate with each other is a profound mystery. Some take for granted the power of language. The Bible is a foundational resource to study language. What is the origin of language? What is the purpose of language? Can language be redeemable? Does it need to be redeemed? There is something powerful about language that we can learn from the entirety of Scripture.</p><h2>The Language of God</h2><p>When you open the Bible you are immediately met with words. Page after page is filled with words, sentences, and paragraphs. You will see, propositions, poetry, songs, proverbs, parables, lamentations, prayers, commandments, and prophecies. All of these structures are using words, commas, periods, question marks, and grammar. You cannot escape language, even in the Bible.</p><p>Language reflects God. According to the Bible, God himself can speak. In Genesis, readers are met with the record that God has created with words. The phrase “<em>God said</em>” or “<em>God called</em>” occurs no less than thirteen times in Genesis. God created everything by simply speaking (Heb. 11:3). He upholds the universe by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3)</p><p>When God wanted to create man, He first contemplated it by saying, “<em>Let us, make man in our image, and after our likeness..</em>” (Gen. 1:26). Man was created from the dust of the ground, which was first created by the spoken Word of God.</p><p>The first recorded interaction between God and man involved language. When God spoke to Adam to give him instructions and commands He used plain language (Gen. 2:15-17). It was not some mysterious code that had to be deciphered. God expressed His will with plain language.</p><p>It should be noted that man was created in the likeness of a speaking God. It was God that made man and man’s mouth (Ex. 4:11). Man was to imitate his creator, so we find Adam speaking and naming the beasts, which God had created (Gen. 2:19). Not only did Adam have the capability of naming animals and creatures, Adam was created with the ability to interact with God using language. Prayer, worship, praise, and adoration with man’s Creator were to be done with heart and mouth (Hebrews 13:15).</p><h2>The Language of Doubt</h2><p>The world was created by words, and it was turned upside down with the use of words. The first question ever recorded in history was asked by a subtle serpent in the Garden of Eden.</p><blockquote><p style="text-align: center;">Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made (Genesis 3:1)</p></blockquote><p>He said to the woman, “<em>Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden</em>’?”</p><p>The word “<em>crafty</em>” in the ESV is translated as “<em>subtle</em>” in other translations. It’s Hebrew meaning is one of deception and being tricky and cunning. The same word is used in Job in one of Eliphaz’s arguments: “<em>For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty</em>”(Job 15:5).</p><p>The serpent used crafty language and it was deceptive in nature. His language was meant to harm God’s creation and man’s relationship with God.</p><p>One question transmitted by language had the capability to ruin. The subtle serpent was a merchant of doubt. He peddled his wares by shrouding his intentions with a question. The phrase “Has God said” rearranges what has been recorded. “God has said” is the proper statement. However, by the subtle rearranging of words, the world was rearranged and man became his own god, ruled by his own desires and passions. Where man was to have dominion now dominates him. Harmony and unity are replaced with dysfunction and division. All because language had been misused and abused.</p><p>Likewise, beloved, death and life are in the power of the tongue (Pro. 18:21). It matters who you listen to, and it matters which words are used and left out. Where there should be a period, instead a question mark is given. Sin and death came on all men simply by believing the lies, or the language of a subtle serpent. Modernity is not any different. Listening, or communicating with merchants of doubt can destroy lives.<em><strong> I’m not just speaking about filthy talk, and cursing. I’m speaking of the YouTube false prophets and the Facebook phonies. The sanctimonious blurbs of Instagram and the 140 characters tweeted by shady characters. Not everything that glitters is gold, and not everything that has a Christian hashtag is true.</strong></em></p><p>What’s more is that Adam stayed silent, while his wife ate the words of deception and swallowed the forbidden fruit. Silence is not always golden, but it loudly verbalizes ignorance and affirmation. Adam’s most powerful weapon of language stayed in its sheath while he stayed silent. God gave him authority and gave him a voice. You must speak up while deception is wholesaled and solicited. If you do not want to buy it, then you must use your voice and speak up. You must buy the truth and sell it not!</p><h2>The Language of Promise</h2><p>Adam and Eve’s eyes were opened and they beheld their own nakedness before each other and before God. God asked the next question, “<em>Where are you?</em>” While there were judgments given to the serpent and Adam and Eve, there was a divine promise articulated using illustrative terminology.</p><p>The seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent would bruise the heel of the promised child (Gen. 3:15). Humanity would need a redeemer and it would come through the Promised Son.<br />The Language of Babel</p><p>Sin and rebellion increased in the earth after the Fall. God summoned Noah to build an ark because the destruction was imminent. God would destroy the earth through the waters of a flood. But after the flood and once the earth was being repopulated through Noah’s seed used the power of language to rebel against God.</p><p>It was at Babel that the whole earth was of one language, and one speech (Gen. 11:1). It was their intention to build a tower whose top may reach unto the heavens; and make a name for themselves lest they would be scattered (Gen. 11:4). However, it was God’s plan that man should be fruitful and multiply and be populate all of the earth (Gen. 1:22; 28; 8:17; 9:1). Man used language to rebel. They had one mind and unification of spirit to stay right where they were. They would make a name for themselves and not for God. So God came down and scattered them and confounded their language (Gen. 11:7). They would not be able to understand each other and they would not be able to stay in one place. God confounded their language, divided their tongues, and forced them to spread out.</p><p>God had judged man’s rebellion by confounding their language, thus language diversified and people groups began to form.</p><h2>The Language of the Law</h2><p>After several hundreds of years, the plan of redemption would take another step forward. God again used the power of language to disseminate His will. God gave Israel the Law of Moses or the Commandments. God met with Moses at Mt. Sinai and spake all of these words to him (Ex. 20:1). The people were to obey God’s voice and keep His covenant (Ex. 19:5). These laws were written by the finger of God (Ex. 31:18).</p><p>The Law was to be the guiding force for all Hebrews. God’s Word was to be obeyed and cherished. God had spoken and they were to live by His law made up of words and language, all which could be understood. The Commandments were to be written on their hearts and written in their homes:</p><blockquote><p>Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates (Deut. 6:4-9).</p></blockquote><p>However, the Law could not redeem. It was only a teacher, a schoolmaster pointing to something greater (Gal. 3:24-25).</p><h2>The Language of the Prophets</h2><p>Though the law was still in force, the people could not and would not keep the Law. They were led by their own emotions and feelings. They did what was right in their own sight. They did not want God as their king but wanted to be like all the other nations.</p><p>Therefore, God unlocked the door to the office of the prophet. Like Moses before them, the prophets spoke on behalf of God reminding the people to keep God’s Laws and commands. Samuel was the original seed of which all later prophets in Israel were the flower and growth. The Lord was with Samuel, and he did not let any of his words fall to the ground (1 Sam. 3:19).</p><p>“<em>Thus saith the Lord</em>”, “<em>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts</em>”, “<em>Thus saith the Lord God</em>” is repeated throughout the OT. God spoke through his prophets and broadcasted his message with Words and language.</p><p>Imagery, poetry, proverbs, parables, songs, lamentations, figures of speech all are used by the prophets to issue God’s promises, punishment, and prophecies. He sent prophets upon whose lips were anointed, and their hearts were aflame, to Israel, Assyria, Babylon, Edom, and Joppa. It’s not that they did not understand the language, rather:</p><blockquote><p>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; And see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, And make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed (Isaiah 6:9–10)</p></blockquote><p>From Samuel to Elisha, from Isaiah to Malachi God spoke through His prophets a divine message using language.</p><p>After the prophets and before the coming of the Messiah there were four hundred years of silence. No prophets. No messengers. No visions. No prophecies. The people would not listen, so heaven became silent. Four hundred years without a message from the Lord.</p><h2>The Language of Jesus Christ</h2><p>Four hundred years of silence was broken by a voice crying in the wilderness. His attire was camel hair, his diet was locusts and wild honey, but his language was preaching. John the Baptist was a preacher, the bridegroom preparing for the one who was to come. John used kingdom vernacular to proclaim the coming Messiah. John did no miracles. Instead, his trade was words and he preached, “Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand!”</p><p>How would God come and bring redemption? Remember, He would be the seed of the woman, coming to crush the head of the subtle and crafty serpent (Gen. 3:15). At this point, words alone could not redeem. The Law and the Prophets could not redeem man and or his language.</p><p>The Apostle John said it like this:</p><blockquote><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was at the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth (Jn. 1:1-5, 14).</p></blockquote><p>Man had closed his ears and closed his eyes to God’s Word. Therefore, The Word became Man. God tabernacled himself in human flesh. Humanity and divinity supernaturally unified in the person of Jesus Christ. He was the Word come to redeem humanity.</p><p>Jesus was the Wisdom of God tabernacled in human flesh. Flesh and blood. Ink and Paper. Wisdom and Knowledge. Understanding and revelation. Words, sentences, and paragraphs. He was not a merchant of doubt, but a Revelation of Truth, and he was the embodiment of Truth. He was the Creator, the Promise, the Law, and the Prophet.</p><p>When people heard Jesus speak, they said, &#8220;never a man spake like this man&#8221; (Jn. 7:46). Others marveled and astonished at His words (Mt. 22:22, Mk. 10:24). Jesus&#8217; words were pregnant with authority unlike the scribes (Mk. 1:22). Every word He spoke was gracious (Lk. 4:22). The disciples knew that they could follow no one else because Jesus had the Words of eternal life (Jn. 6:68).</p><h3>What Jesus Spoke</h3><p>When Jesus was tempted of satan in the wilderness He used the Word of God to combat his enemy,<br />&#8220;But he answered, It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God’&#8221;(Matthew 4:4). Three times He defeated temptation with the Word of God.</p><p>His command of words, imagery, and language was at His beckoning when He taught the people using parables (Mt. 13:34). Jesus believed the words that He spoke were eternal (Matthew 24:35). If a person was ashamed of Christ&#8217;s words then He would be ashamed of that person (Mark 8:38). Jesus&#8217; words were not just simply to be cognitive exercises, rather they were life and spirit giving expressions (Jn. 6:33). Rejection of Jesus&#8217; words meant eternal judgment (Jn. 12:48). Anyone who desired to have their prayers answered must first allow the words of Christ to abide in them (John 15:7)</p><h2>The Language of Pentecost</h2><p>Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would be given. Jesus said the Holy Spirit would be a Comforter that would “teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you” (John 14:26; Lk. 12:12). The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Now as the Holy Spirit He would dwell in our flesh and dwell in us! The Holy Spirit would be the empowering force that would be shed abroad in our hearts. The Holy Spirit</p><blockquote><p>When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance (Acts 2:1–4)</p></blockquote><p>Jesus Christ was the Word made flesh and purchased our redemption. But it was not just our hearts that needed redemption, but it was also our tongue. The world was created and sustained by the Word, it was the Word that was given at Sinai, the prophecy from the prophets, the Gospel preached from John, Jesus, and the Apostles and it’s the Holy Spirit within us taking over our hearts and our tongues.</p><p>Speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives the ability is not some coincidence or accident. No, it was language that ignited the fall of humanity, and man&#8217;s language too that needed to be redeemed. God knew that if He could change the hearts of humanity, then He could take control of their tongue (Jm. 2:8). If a man&#8217;s tongue can set the world afire, then we should seek the Word made flesh to come and redeem our hearts, set aflame our tongues, that we may boldly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>	100	\N	Theology of Language	\N	/raphael-schaller-GkinCd2enIY-unsplash.jpg
665	2018-02-19 16:17:45	\N	\N	\N	<p>In this episode we look at the differences in the various calls of ministry, and specifically the call to the ministry.</p><ul><li>Called to Minister</li><li>Called to Ministry</li><li>Called to <em>the</em> Ministry</li></ul><h2>Called to Minister</h2><p>Every Christian is called to minister. This is our service to the body of Jesus Christ. Each member of the body of Christ offers value with their respective giftings.</p><p>First Corinthians 12-14 and Romans 12 reveal how God has gifted every believer to function in the body of Christ.</p><h2>Called to Ministry</h2><p>Your vocation has a direct ministerial component to it. You do not have to meet 1 Timothy 3 qualifications, or have to be ordained.</p><p>Children&#8217;s ministry, ministry and church administration, teacher at a Christian school, church faculty and staff. This is serving the church and the Kingdom of God in ministry.</p><h2>Called to the Ministry</h2><p>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12)</p><p>The ministry is defined in its own category in Ephesians 4:11-16, 1 Tim. 3:1-7, Titus 1:6-9. These are specific offices and functions that God calls and ordains to lead the church.</p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">Be sure to subscribe to the podcast!</div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">For more information go to my website <a href="http://nswhitley.com">nswhitley.com </a></div><div data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"></div><div data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">Check out the <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/30/gods-plan-for-redemption/">Bible Exposition Podcast</a> and listen to our series God&#8217;s Plan for Redemption!</div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"></div><div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">Follow me on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/nswhitley">@nswhitley</a></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">Like and share my Facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nswhitley/">https://www.facebook.com/nswhitley/</a></div></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0">Download my eBook <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Art-Spiritual-Disciplines-ebook/dp/B00C9GENFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492446690&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+lost+art+of+spiritual+disciplines"><em>The Lost Art of Spiritual Disciplines</em></a> on Amazon</div><div data-offset-key="e4ks5-0-0"><p>N.S.

667	2018-02-12 12:19:50	\N	\N	\N	<p>Ecclesiastes was penned at the hand of Israel’s King Solomon, the son of David (1:1). In the Hebrew, he calls himself “<em>Qoheleth</em>” which means “<em>preacher</em>” or “<em>teacher</em>.” The name Ecclesiastes comes from the Greek (not the Hebrew) and is a form of <em>ekklesia</em> which is the Greek word for “c<em>hurch</em>” in the NT. Therefore, on a more specific note, Ecclesiastes refers to an assembly and Solomon is the Preacher addressing the congregation.</p><p>In Proverbs, Solomon takes the posture of a wise sage giving advice to his young son. In Song of Solomon, he is a man of love poetically penning a divine romance. However, in Ecclesiastes, he takes the role of a time-worn preacher. His sermon does not tickle the ears of his listeners nor does he attempt to dull the sharpness of his message. Solomon doesn’t sound like the ivory tower scholar of Proverbs or the romanticist of Song of Solomon.</p><p>If Proverbs was addressed to the simple to implore them to seek wisdom (Prov. 1:4, 22), and if Song of Solomon was a description of pre-sin edenic love in its purest form, then what is Ecclesiastes? The Preacher’s congregation and future readers are invited to see humanity’s flaws and brokenness and enticed to see God’s goodness. In other word’s the message of Ecclesiastes is the Gospel. It may not explicitly explain justification by faith, and the covenant of grace through Jesus Christ. Rather, the Preacher gives a palpability of sin, and the grandeur of God’s goodness.</p><h2>Meaningless, Meaningless!</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="en-US">&#8220;Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity. </span></em><span lang="en-US"><em>What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun&#8221;</em> (<strong>Ecclesiastes 1:2–3</strong>)<br /></span></p><p>“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,” says the Preacher. This phrase is used thirty-six times in Ecclesiastes. The word for “<em>vanity</em>” in Hebrew does not mean “excessive pride” like we may think. Instead, this word “<em>hebe</em>l” means “<em>wind</em>,” “<em>vapor</em>,” “<em>puff of smoke</em>” or “<em>breath</em>.” Taken literally, the Hebrew word refers to a puff of smoke rising from a chimney in the winter or the cloud of steam that rises from a hot cup of coffee.</p><p>According to the Preacher, life is like that. It is nothing more than a vapor, or a mist. Here for a moment. You see it, then it is gone. Even the Bible compares our lives to a mere breath (Ps. 39:5), and to a mist that appears for a short time then vanishes (Jam. 4:14).</p><p>The Preacher connects the transience of life with life’s meaningless pursuits and declares that they are vanity! The NIV translates “<em>hebel</em>” as meaningless. The Preacher wants to let his assembly know that a life that pursues trivial things will also end up meaningless. “<em>All is vanity</em>” according to the Preacher. Life is full of frustrated futility. Nothing that is here in this life will make us happy. It is vanity and a “<em>vexation of spirit</em>” (1:14). This phrase in the Hebrew refers to a chasing after wind. Chasing after vapors are meaningless. Not being able to acquire a vapor causes a vexation of spirit.</p><p>To prove his point the Preacher takes the things that people ordinarily use to give purpose or to find satisfaction and then shows how empty they are. Keep in mind that this preacher is Solomon. The man who had it all. Solomon had attained what the world believes brings pleasure and gratification. Solomon acquired wealth. He ruled over a vast domain. He was a lover extraordinaire. He never lacked an audience to come and listen to his wisdom or to see his riches. This Preacher had it all! And this is what he had to say about it:</p><p>“<em>Vanity of vanities! All is vanity</em>!”</p><ul><li>All that is done under the sun is vanity (Ecc. 1:14)</li><li>Pleasure is vanity (Ecc. 2:1)</li><li>Work is vanity (Ecc. 2:11)</li><li>Wisdom is vanity (Ecc. 2:15)</li><li>Laboring night and day is vanity (Ecc. 2:23)</li><li>Money is vanity (Ecc. 5:10)</li><li>Wealth, possessions, and honor are vanity (Ecc. 6:2)</li><li>Building and erecting beautiful edifices is vanity (Ecc. 6:9)</li><li>The days of a man’s life are vanity (Ecc. 6:12)</li><li>Long life is vanity (Ecc. 11:8)</li><li>Youth and energy are vanities (Ecc. 11:10)</li><li>Everything is vanity (Ecc. 1:2; 12:8)</li></ul><h2>The Search for Meaning in Wisdom (Ecc. 1:12-18)</h2><p>The Preacher began his search for purpose in wisdom (Ecc. 1:12-18). He thought, perhaps, that he would find meaning in knowledge and understanding.</p><p>At the beginning of Solomon’s reign, he petitioned the Lord for understanding in leading Israel (1 Kings 3:7-9). The Lord granted his request and gave him much more than he desired (1 Kings 3:10-14). After this, Solomon was considered the wisest man to live (1 Kings 3:28). God had given him wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the past and all the wisdom of Egypt (1 Kings 4:29-31). Additionally, Solomon was an accomplished writer penning 3,000 proverbs and writing 1,005 songs (1 Kings 4:32).</p><p>This is what Solomon confirmed in his search for meaning in wisdom:</p><p class="passageheader" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="en-US">&nbsp;&#8220;</span><em><span lang="en-US">I said in my heart, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” </span><span lang="en-US">And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind. </span></em><span lang="en-US"><em>For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow&#8221;</em> (<strong>Ecclesiastes 1:16–18</strong>)<br /></span></p><p>Solomon’s great wisdom did not unlock happiness or meaning. Solomon studied the world and only found emptiness. The poor were oppressed and had no one to comfort them (Ecc. 4:1). Though God created man to be upright, there wasn’t a righteous man found on earth who did good and never sinned (Ecc. 7:20, 29). He found people cursing each other (Ecc. 7:21-22). Evil men doing evil works and getting away with it (Ecc. 8:10-13). Further, evil and folly are found on king’s thrones (Ecc. 10:5-6).</p><p>The increase of wisdom and knowledge only brought about grief and sorrow. Wisdom did not give him rose-colored glasses, alternatively, it unveiled the emptiness of all that was under the sun. Which led Solomon to conclude the <span class="me" data-syllable="e·phem·er·al·i·ty"><span class="js-headword"><span class="syllable">e</span><span class="syllable">phem</span><span class="syllable">er</span><span class="syllable">al</span><span class="syllable">i</span><span class="last-syllable">ty </span></span></span>of life.</p><p class="passageheader" style="text-align: center;"><span class="verseChar" lang="en-US">&#8220;</span><em><span lang="en-US">Then I said in my heart, “What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity. </span></em><span lang="en-US"><em>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!</em>&#8221; (<strong>Ecclesiastes 2:15–16</strong>)<br /></span></p><p>Wisdom would not prolong Solomon’s life. Both the wise and the foolish would meet the same end. It is not that wisdom is useless. Rather, wisdom and understanding do not bring meaning to life. This is wisdom!</p><h2>The Search for Meaning in Pleasure (Ecc. 2:1-11)</h2><p class="passageheader" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="en-US"><em>I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity</em> (<strong>Ecclesiastes 2:1</strong>)<br /></span></p><p>Next, the preacher looked for meaning in pleasure. He searched where others have tried to find meaning and ended up at the same mountain peak of disenchantment. Pleasure doesn’t accomplish anything. Pleasure seeking costs more than it profits. It is a chasing after wind, a vexation of spirit. Ask anyone who seeks to find meaning in pleasure. What they hope to last a lifetime disappears in a moment. Pleasure isn’t eternal. It is a temporary high to alleviate momentary pain or a present boredom. It is trying to grasp what cannot be seized.</p><p>The long list of escape methods included mirth (laughter), wine, building projects, accumulating wealth, art, gardens, orchards, trees, pools of water, servants, maidens, great herds of animals, silver, gold, choirs, and women.</p><p>The world has searched high and low to find meaning in pleasure. They have explored far and wide to obtain purpose in gratification. However, like the Preacher they conclude:</p><ul><li>Laughter is vanity (2:1)</li><li>Drinking wine is vanity (2:3)</li><li>Building large homes is vanity (2:4)</li><li>Planting fruitful vineyards is vanity (2:4)</li><li>Having people serve and work for you is vanity (2:7)</li><li>Great possessions is vanity (2:7)</li><li>Considerable riches is vanity (2:8)</li><li>Listening and making magnificent music is vanity (2:8)</li></ul><p>When he had expended these many attempts at lasting fulfillment and contentment, he concluded it was all vanity, with no lasting pleasure and fulfillment. Solomon accumulated more than any man before him. He was impressive in the sight of jealous and envious men. Every single longing of his heart was granted completely. Finally, like a world conqueror, he realized it was all just more of the same. This conclusion alone makes the book of Ecclesiastes of immense value to all people who will hear. A few centuries later the venerable Apostle John will echo the Preacher’s sentiment:</p><p class="verse" style="text-align: center;"><em><span lang="en-US">Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. </span><span lang="en-US">For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. </span><span lang="en-US">And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever </span></em>(<strong>1 John 2:15–17</strong>).</p><h2>The Search for Meaning in Work (2:17-26)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><em>&nbsp;&#8220;</em><em><span lang="en-US">Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun. </span><span lang="en-US">So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> </em><span lang="en-US"><em>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me</em>&#8221; </span>(<strong>Ecclesiastes 2:11, 17–18</strong>)</p><p>Many believe that work will give them a sense of purpose in life. Perhaps this explains why one of the first things people ask when they meet someone new is ‘What do you do for a living?’ However, work is the wrong place to look for meaning in life. The Preacher had looked to wisdom for meaning, to pleasure for satisfaction, and now he puts his sights on work for purpose.</p><p>The Preacher surveyed the work that he had accomplished and it too was vanity and vexation of spirit. Solomon had accomplished no small feats! A magnificent temple that had no parallel. Along with the temple he built homes for himself and his Egyptian wife. He had judged the people of Israel with wisdom and understanding.</p><p>Work and achievement fail on their own premises. As the Preacher recognizes, the results of toil are wiped away by history. The person who follows you may impoverish all you have accomplished (Ecc. 2:21). Secondly, work fails to satisfy. Labor and toil bring grief and pain. Getting up early and then late to bed, often times losing sleep to thoughts of not accomplishing your tasks. This too is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p><p>Work and achievement, without the peace of God, will never satisfy.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Consider Tom Brady, the quarterback of football’s New England Patriots, who wanted to know, &#8220;<em>Why do I have three Super Bowl rings and still think there’s something greater out there for me? I mean, maybe a lot of people would say, &#8216;Hey man, this is what is. I reached my goal, my dream, my life. Me, I think, &#8216;It’s got to be more than this. I mean this isn’t, this can’t be what it’s all cracked up to be.</em>&#8221; When the interviewer asked, &#8220;<em>What’s the answer</em>?&#8221; Brady could only say, &#8220;<em>I wish I knew. I wish I knew</em>.&#8221;</p><p>The time-worn preacher discovered that everything under the sun was vanity. Everything under the sun did not give satisfaction. Almost every verse in Ecclesiastes shows us how much we need a Savior to make all things new.</p><p>According to the Preacher, everything under the sun is meaningless. ‘Under the sun’ expresses the extent of our problem. Where do we experience life’s futility and frustration? Everywhere the sun shines. Yet this phrase also opens up the possibility of a different perspective. To see things ‘under the sun’ is to look at them from the ground level, taking an earthly point of view and leaving God out of the picture.</p><p>Of course, this is not the right way of looking at things. There is a God who rules over the sun. Ecclesiastes shows us the weariness of life and the frustrations of giving under the sun. It reveals that what is under the sun cannot give meaning, satisfaction or purpose. You will never find meaning in wisdom, sex, wealth, romance, partying, or power. Bible commentator, Phil Ryken, writes, “One way to gain this divine perspective is to take all of the things that make life so wearisome and see what a difference it makes when we bring God back into the picture.”</p><p>Therefore, brothers and sisters, what is the end of it all? It is to fear God and keep his commandments (Ecc.12:13-14). The preacher has summarized that the Creator God is good and wise. In His sovereignty, He has placed eternity in our hearts (Ecc. 3:10). The issue is that man attempts to fill it with pleasure, wisdom, toil, relationships, the pursuit of wealth, and education and yet it leaves him empty. It is vanity of vanities! Meaningless! A striving after wind.</p><p>A greater than Solomon appears in the NT. He is the ultimate Son of David. He speaks in parables, proverbs, and cynicism: “What does it profit a man if he gains the world and loses His soul?” Jesus, the Son of David, Who is the image of the invisible God, the Creator of heaven and earth. It was this preacher, who looked at a woman who simply came to draw water for her thirst who had been with five men, whom she called husbands, Jesus tells her, with an echo of Ecclesiastes: “If you drink of this water you will thirst again. But if you drink from the living water you will never thirst.” When you drink from the world’s pleasure, you will only be thirsty still. The temporal striving under the sun that she lost a lifetime to, could be replaced with an eternal thirst quencher that was in her heart. The vapor of ruined relationships, vain desires. Jesus wasn’t offering a vapor, He was offering the substance.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, Jesus wants you to stop chasing vapors, and drink from the substance. The end of the matter is fear God and obey his commandments. The meaningless fades with the wind and is replaced with divine purpose.</p><p>This is the gospel according to Ecclesiastes.</p>	100	\N	The Gospel According to Ecclesiastes	\N	/yosh-ginsu-146166-unsplash.jpg
668	2018-02-08 15:44:09	\N	\N	\N	<p>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved. (Matthew 9:14–17)</p><h2>Something New</h2><p>The prophet Jeremiah foretold of a day that God was going propose a new covenant with Israel:</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&#8221; (Jeremiah 31:31–33)</p></blockquote><p>The Lord was declaring that He would do a new thing within the hearts of Israel (Isaiah 43:16-21). The old covenant was going to be fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not abolishing the Law of Moses, rather He was coming to fulfill every part of it. And it was in the Law and Prophets that spoke of Him (Luke 24:27).</p><p>Looking at the last part Matthew 9:17, “neither is new wine put into old wineskins.” Bible commentator, William Barclay, writes, “<em>In the old days, wine was stored in skins and not in bottles. When new wine was put into a skin, the wine was still fermenting. The gases which it gave off exerted pressure on the skin. In a new skin there was a certain elasticity, and no harm was done because the skin gave with the pressure. But an old skin had grown hard and had lost all its elasticity, and, if new and fermenting wine was put into it, it could not give to the pressure of the gases; it could only burst.</em>”</p><p>Jesus had come to embark on the journey of establishing the new covenant, which included giving the new wine of Holy Spirit, giving men new hearts, and new lives, and would eventually bring about the new heaven and new earth. Jesus embodied the message and principles of the new covenant. Therefore, it is not surprising that the religious leaders of Judaism had issues with Jesus draining the old wine from the old wineskins.</p><p>An orthodox interpretation of Matthew 9:17 is Jesus and the gospel are the new wine, and the old religious system of Judaism are the old wineskins. The new wineskins are the new conduct, and ideas that uphold the new wine of Jesus and the gospel. If you pour the new wine into the old wineskins they will burst.</p><p>Now, we should consider the context of Matthew 9:14-17. At the beginning of this chapter, we see three groups of people asking three questions. Each group is concerned about their wineskin and Jesus’ profound new teaching. Keep in mind, that Jesus taught with power and authority unlike the religious teachers of His day (Matt. 7:29). If these religious teachers and their teaching had been truly effective then there would have never been a need for a new covenant.</p><h2>The Scribes</h2><p>In Matthew 9:1-8 records Jesus healing a paralytic man. Jesus declares that the man’s sins are forgiven before He heals his body (Matt. 9:2). To Jesus, the condition of the man’s heart was of first importance. The scribes, who taught the people in the local synagogues, heard this they asked, “Who can forgive sins but God alone” (Matt. 9:3; Mark 2:6)? The old wineskin answer to that was no one. For someone to be forgiven for their sins they needed a sacrifice, an altar, a mediating priest, and for God to accept the sacrifice. But now the new wineskin answer is that Jesus is faithful and just to forgive sins and cleanse from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p><h2>The Pharisees</h2><p>After this, Matthew 9:9-13 records Jesus calling Matthew, a tax collecting traitor, and going to his house to eat. Jesus and His disciples began to break bread with many tax collectors and sinners (Matt. 9:10). The Pharisees, leaders of the strictest form of Judaism at that time, asked, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” The Pharisees were concerned about their old wineskin coming into contact with anything that could contaminate. They were very concerned with everyone else’s spiritual well-being but their own.</p><p>Jesus used new wine to answer his skeptics: “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” This new wine of an answer burst the Pharisee self-righteous wineskin.</p><h2>John the Baptist’s Followers</h2><p>Now, the third and final question comes from John the Baptist’s followers. The Pharisees don’t like that Jesus is eating with tax-collectors and sinners, and John’s followers don’t like that Jesus is eating at all. The Jews fasted once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). However, the Pharisees and other more aesthetic Jews would fast two days a week.</p><p>Fasting was about mourning and sorrow. However, Jesus’ answer revealed that the new wine was about joy and not mourning.</p><p>Jesus answers:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;</em>And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.&#8221; (Matt. 9:15-16)</p></blockquote><h2>Patchwork</h2><p>Now, this is an interesting answer. Jesus makes reference to the new wine and old wineskins. Then he follows that analogy with another concerning patchwork.</p><p>The current generation doesn’t know much about patchwork. If they tear some of their clothing chances are they just throw it away and replace it. However, many of us remember what it was like to tear something then having it patched.</p><p>Jesus wasn’t a reformer come to reform Judaism. The Jew’s faith didn’t need a reformation or patchwork. Rather, sin-torn humanity needed something new. Humanity didn’t need a patch to cover their tears and brokenness. No, they needed new hearts, new lives, new wineskins, new everything.</p><p>The Jew’s faith was threadbare and worn out. It had been torn by religious exercises that brought them no relief from their sin. Sin had rent and torn their lives.</p><p><em>The Pharisee’s constantly adding to the Law had brought about a friction that left man with more holes than holiness</em>. Jesus didn’t come to mend and patch, but to make new. Jesus didn’t come to reform humanity, but to transform humanity.</p><h2>Patchwork Religion</h2><p>The questions concerning forgiveness, holiness, and spiritual disciplines were acceptable. Man needs forgiveness, holiness, and spiritual exercises. But, Judaism, like most religions of the world, they teach that man has to do something before their god accepts them. Christianity is unlike all other religions in that God has brought about salvation though we were undeserving:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation&#8221; (Romans 5:6–11).</p></blockquote><p>Considering that Jesus saved us, not based upon our merit, but upon His love for us, we, in turn, live for Him. Our works did not save us, but since He saved us we do good works.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them&#8221; (Ephesians 2:8–10).</p></blockquote><p>The Pharisees believed that all of their Law-keeping would gain them acceptance. However, the Rich Young Ruler (Matthew 19:16-22) kept the commandments and knew deep down that he was missing something. The tear in his life didn’t need a patch. It needed to be renewed. Christianity is not a patchwork religion. It is not about piecing it together in hopes that it survives another day.</p><h2>Patchwork Humanity</h2><p>Pastor-theologian, John MacArthur writes, “<em>No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment and a worse tear results. Cloth of that day was primarily wool or linen, and both would shrink when washed. If a patch of new, unshrunk, cloth is sewn on an old garment, Jesus reminded them, then the first time the garment is washed, the new patch shrinks and pulls away from the garment, making a worse tear than before.</em>”</p><p><strong>The world thinks that they can improve itself with patchwork:</strong></p><ul><li>Exercise and diet more</li><li>Take chemicals through drinking, needles, and pills</li><li>Think positive</li><li>Pursue wealth</li><li>Educate yourself</li><li>Do what feels good</li><li>Have multiple relationships</li></ul><p>These are nothing more than patches on a sin-torn life. Some may help for a time, but too much stress where the patch is applied and it will tear.</p><p>Christianity is not something stitched onto your life. Christianity pervades the entire person. Salvation touches every part of your life: heart, soul, mind, strength. Christianity isn’t a fashion statement then goes out of style. It is in season in every season of life. Finally, Christianity isn’t tacked onto to cover defects. No, salvation heals all brokenness where sin has been worn.</p><p>Jesus wants to remake, that’s the point of the regeneration. That is the New Birth experience of being born again of water and spirit (John 3:1-14).</p><p>What are you attempting to patch? A patch may work for a little while, but before long you will need new clothes. Jesus wants to make you new. Jesus wants to make old things pass away and make all things new (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>	100	\N	Patchwork Religion	\N	/joao-tzanno-543468-unsplash.jpg
669	2018-01-31 14:11:18	\N	\N	\N	<p>Venturing to read and study Scripture can be intimidating for some Christians. Each may have their own stumbling blocks as to why they aren’t able to consistently engage with the Bible. However, God desires for each Christian to spend time with His Word. It is through the truth of God’s Word that we are sanctified (John 17:17). Like any obstacle to reaching your intended goals you have to start somewhere. Below I have given five tips to engage with Scripture. Certainly, much more could be added to this list. It is my hope that this will at least inspire Christians to begin to engage with Scripture.</p><h3>1. Prepare Your Heart For Scripture</h3><p>David prayed, “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law” (Psalm 119:18). Before reading and studying Scripture you should take time to pray this prayer. If you struggle understanding Scripture, or lack the initiative and desire to read the Bible then this prayer is a great place to start. Preparing the soil of our hearts ready to receive the seed of God’s Word helps produce a harvest of fruitful understanding and application (Matthew 13:1-9,18-23).</p><h3>2. Make Time For Scripture</h3><p>Successful Bible study comes from consistent reading and studying. You cannot be sporadic in Bible study to learn and grow. Creating a habit of reading and studying your Bible will produce spiritual growth. You aren’t going to learn all there is to know about the Bible in one sitting, one week, or even one year. It is line upon line, line upon line, precept upon precept, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little (Isaiah 28:13).</p><p>You should schedule your Bible reading and prayer time. Some will do these two disciplines together. The point is to do it consistently. Jesus didn’t heal and minister twenty-four hours a day every day, there were times when He would get alone with the Father (Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, 22:39-44). The man Christ Jesus wasn’t so busy that He didn’t make time to be alone with God.</p><p>The best time is when you are at your best. Personally, for me, that’s in the early morning. I get much more done in the morning than any other time. “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all of His righteousness” can be applicable here. If we put God first in our day then He will be first the rest of the day. Others are at their best at night. However, just don’t try to serve God with what’s left of your day. As Christians we are to give Christ our first fruits, not the left overs.</p><h3>3. Meditate On Scripture</h3><p>Meditation has been given a bad reputation in Western culture. We connect meditation with yoga, humanism and the worship of creation. But this is not what the Bible speaks of when it mentions meditation. Popular meditation nowadays is thought of as a way to empty our minds and go to an imaginary place. Rather, Biblical meditation is a filling up of our minds and hearts with godliness. Our focus is to meditate on the law of God, His Word (Ps.1:2).</p><p>Biblical meditation is where we fix our heart and mind on Jesus (Duet 6:5). Take what you have just read in your devotions, and then think on that verse, or passage. Read that passage over and over again. Write it down, take it with you and try to memorize it. Before concluding your time of devotion, meditate on that scripture then seek to apply it.</p><h3>4. Topically Study Scripture</h3><p>Another way to engage with Scripture is to choose a particular topic you may feel led to study. For instance, you could study such topics as faith, repentance, or baptism. These are very important subjects worthy of study. Also, you could begin a study on all the prayers of the New Testament. Another interesting study are repeated phrases throughout the Old or New Testaments. You could study Jesus’ “I Am” statements in the Gospel of John. Another phrase used several times in Paul’s writings is “in Christ” or “in Jesus.” Taking the time to systematically study Scripture is very beneficial for your spiritual growth.</p><h3>5. Focusing on Particular Books of Scripture</h3><p>Attempting to read the entire Bible may seem daunting. However, such an intimidating task shouldn’t deter your enthusiasm for engaging with the Bible. To keep yourself in engaged with Scripture you can read and study particular portions of Scripture. Begin with reading the four Gospels, or the New Testament Epistles. The book of Psalms is made up of one hundred and fifty chapters. Reading five chapters of Psalms each day for a month would take you through the entire book. If you coupled this with reading one chapter of Proverbs each day you will have read this fascinating book as well. This is a discipline I currently use each month and it has paid many spiritual dividends.</p><p>Finally, you could listen to the Bible on audio. I listen to Scripture in the mornings while I’m getting ready for my day, and when I’m in my vehicle. You shouldn’t feel condemned listening to Scripture, because keep in mind faith comes by hearing the Word of God (Romans 10:17). There are a plethora of Bible apps on mobile devices to keep you organized, disciplined and connected to Scripture. I personally use YouVersion for listening to Scripture and keeping track of my reading.</p><p>Whether you are just beginning your journey in studying the Word of God, or you’re a seasoned student of Scripture, these are few tips to engage with Scripture.</p>	100	\N	Five Tips to Engage with Scripture	\N

671	2018-01-22 08:05:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>It is the twelfth year of Solomon’s reign and the newly minted Temple had been active for close to a year now. King David provided the material and blueprints for the beautiful edifice that will be inhabited by God’s Spirit. However it was David’s son Solomon who labored to have the most amazing house built for Jehovah. Up until this time God had only dwelt among His people in a tent. Now, the Levitical priesthood would serve God at a permanent location in Jerusalem, the nation of Israel’s capital city.</p><p>Now, we travel north of Jerusalem to Issachar. Issachar was about 2-4 days journey by foot north of Jerusalem. The tribe of Issachar was given land between Zebulun, and Manasseh. Issachar was Jacob’s ninth son, his fifth with Leah.The tribe of Issachar was known for fighting alongside Deborah, of which she was a member. The men of Issachar were known as “men who had understanding of the times” (1 Ch. 12:32).</p><p>In this land we are introduced to a man by the name of Joah who was a member of Issachar. Joah was employed by a more wealthy man to shepherd a flock. Everyday he went and called for the flock from the sheep gate. It was Joah’s responsibility to make sure the flock had something to eat, and drink, and to protect them from any predators. Joah was responsible to repay his owner if there was any loss of the flock.</p><p>Joah had been married to his wife, Moriah for fifteen years. Together they had two children, a daughter named Jerusha, and son named Joseph. They were not a wealthy family, but they always had what they needed. Joah came from a long history of faithful followers of Jehovah. However, Joah had been experiencing guilt of sin, and wrestling with doubt. Quietly he kept his shame and fear to himself. As he led his flock in the northern pastures of Israel he would spend time alone with his thoughts:</p><p>“How do I know my sins can be forgiven?”<br />“How can I keep all of God’s laws?”<br />“Does Jehovah really forgive me?”<br />“How can I remove my guilt and shame?”<br />“Will the Covenant Lord of Israel accept me?”</p><p>Day after day, night after night, Joah lived with these questions. He desired liberty, longed for assurance, and desperately needed forgiveness. His questions, doubt, and guilt were miserable comforters.</p><h2>The Whole Burnt Offering</h2><p>After several nights of lost sleep Joah decided to take a few steps of faith. It wasn’t the time of the Passover, or the day of Atonement. But in order for Joah to lift the burden of sin, and doubt he was going to have to offer a sacrifice. Joah remembered the laws concerning the Whole Burnt Offering. Joah could still hear his mother teaching him as a child about this sacrifice from the first part of Leviticus. The Law and sacrifices were an important aspect of the Hebrew home. Deep down inside, Joah knew God was faithful to His covenant with Israel.</p><p>The first sacrifice described in Leviticus (chap. 1; also 6:8–18) is the &#8220;<em>olah</em>&#8221; sacrifice. By virtue of its coming first in the list of sacrifices, we can assume its importance. With the exception of the Day of Atonement, where the sin offering took center place, the &#8220;<em>olah</em>&#8221; sacrifice was the most important sacrifice at Israelite festivals (Num. 28–29). Perhaps even more importantly, the &#8220;<em>olah</em>&#8221; was offered twice each day, once in the morning and once in the evening (Num. 28:1–8).</p><p>The Hebrew word “<em>olah</em>” is defined as “rising up” and refers to the smoke rising from off of the sacrifice, the smoke ascending from earth unto heaven, which was very pleasing unto the Lord. Everything from the Whole Burnt Offering went up in smoke. Unlike some of the other sacrifices, no portion of this sacrifice was to be consumed by the priests. The entire offering went up in smoke.</p><p>Unfortunately for Joah he would have to travel close to 150 miles south to Jerusalem to get to Solomon’s temple. Such a trip would take 2-4 days of walking depending on the weather and any other unexpected events.</p><p>Not only would the journey be exhausting, Joah was going to have to provide the sacrifice. This too was going to be costly, but of course sacrifice always costs something. The law said that a man could offer what he could afford. However, if the offerer could afford a bull, lamb, or goat, but only brought dove then it would not be accepted. Israel’s history was plagued with the story of Cain not bringing the offering that he could afford. Such a sacrifice was rejected by God, and if Joah tried to do the same thing it too would be rejected. And listen, Joah already felt worthless and rejected due to his sin, there was no sense in trying to bring something less than he could afford.</p><p>So he went and purchased a lamb from his employer. Joah knew that flock well. He knew which lambs were weak and sickly. He knew which ones were the very best. Joah went to retrieve one that he knew might not be very expensive. But his heart smote him, and he turned and found the healthiest lamb that had neither a spot or blemish in its coat. Moriah’s eyes widened when she heard what that lamb was going to cost.</p><p>“I know this is going to cost us, and put us behind a little, but it will be worth it once we get to Jerusalem” Joah said to Moriah. Joah in his mind rehearsed what David said to Araunah concerning the burnt sacrifice: “I will buy it from your a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing” (2 Sam. 24:24). Joah paid for the healthy lamb, and began gathering everything together for the journey to Jerusalem. With his wife and two children with him he headed towards forgiveness.</p><p>A two to four day journey by foot was difficult, but with each step in the hot dusty sand Joah’s steps got lighter. Even though he had sweat running down his face, and his back, hips and feet were aching Joah felt a little better as they approached Jerusalem.</p><p>However there was a moment, despite hearing his children asking how much longer the trip would be, and their mother trying to encourage their patience that Joah looked down and caught a glimpse of that lamb. Joah had seen that lamb before in the flock that he shepherded. That lamb had been with them now for close to three days journey, and not once did that lamb try to run away. There wasn’t one time that the lamb cried out in fear. The lamb was silent, and innocent. Joah remembered an old saying among the tribes, “and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.”</p><h2>Journey Towards Jerusalem</h2><p>Joah, Moriah, Jerusha and Joseph finally made it to Jerusalem on the afternoon of the fourth day. Israel’s capital seemed quiet that afternoon. The usual hustle and bustle of the city streets were strangely quiet. The sun was about to set, and the city was starting to cool. Peaking over the homes and buildings of the stood Solomon’s Temple. Joah had been to Jerusalem for Solomon’s Temple inauguration. He remembered the crowds, the festivities, the sacrifices and the glory. What a glorious day that was.</p><p>Joah secured a place for his family to stay for a few days, then he proceeded to the Temple with the lamb. Joah’s own guilt, was starting to be displaced with the guilt that this poor innocent lamb was about to take his place.</p><p>Joah approached the Temple courtyard. He was met by a couple of the Levitical priests, one was obviously older than the other. Joah could smell the burning flesh from the altar.</p><p>The younger of the two priests asked Joah, “What are you offering the Lord?” Joah replied, “A burnt offering.” “Good” replied the priest, “the law says we are to offer one burnt offering in the morning and one in the evening. This happens to be the one we will use for the evening sacrifice. What have you brought to sacrifice?” Joah, with a lump in his throat said, “This lamb. I am hoping this will be acceptable for my offering and forgiveness.” The older of the two priests began to inspect Joah’s lamb. “This is a spotless lamb, my son.”</p><p>Joah, the approved lamb, and the priests progressed towards the bronze altar. The altar was 30 feet by 30 feet by 15 feet tall. The altar is stained with blood on its bronze horns. There is still ash burning on the altar from the previous sacrifice. The wind caught some of the smoke and began to burn Joah’s eyes. Beneath the altar is a basin where the spilled blood is caught. Joah’s stomach begins to get queasy, he had never been this close to the altar before and the sight of burning flesh and spilled blood made him feel weak. Joah’s nerves start to rattle in fear that he might do something wrong or embarrassing. Joah feared embarrassment about as much as he feared the Lord.</p><p>“Son, you need to put your hand on the lamb’s head. And here, take this knife and slit its throat” said the young priest. Joah felt his knees buckle, and another lump came up in his throat.</p><p>According to the Law the sacrifice must be identified with the offerer. The sacred event would begin as soon as the offerer placed his hand on the sacrifice. The innocent lamb was going to take his place, the spotless lamb would be Joah’s substitute. The act of laying a hand on the animal was connected with atonement and forgiveness. This was a sacred act of Joah imparting his sins, doubts, fears and guilt upon the lamb. Joah never intended to hurt that innocent lamb, but he also did not intend to offend God with his sin. But if Joah was going to be accepted by God, then he needed to place his guilt-ridden hands on the lamb.</p><p>Joah blinked his eyes nervously still blinking the sting of the smoke out of them, all the while holding back his tears and anguish. His other hand held the knife that would take the life of the lamb. Joah whispered a prayer as the priests fetched their tools and prepared the altar, “Adonai, Elohim, please forgive me of my trespasses and sin. Cover me again. Please accept this innocent lamb’s life as a substitute for my own.” Joah closed his eyes and quickly slit the throat of the lamb. This dramatic event was an emotional experience- the animal died at the hand of the Joah, it crumpled to the ground at his feet. The blood spilled from his lifeless body. The priests hurried to catch the blood in the basin, and then dashed the blood against the altar. The priests began to skin the sacrifice, and cut it into pieces. The young priest washed the entrails, while the older priest burned the cut up pieces, which included the head and fat.</p><p>Joah stood trembling at the sight that seemed like it passed so quickly. Joah watched in amazement as the priests burned everything on the altar. With the whole burnt offering the priests took nothing for themselves, the entire sacrifice was for the Lord. It represented the offerer. The sacrifice was for atonement, the Hebrew word for atonement in Leviticus 1:4 means to “appease,” “pacify,” or “cover.” In other words, Joah was being cleansed of impurities, and becoming reconciled to God.</p><p>The priests and Joah watched the innocent lamb burn to ash upon the altars. The blood ran down the horns and the sides of the altar, and the fire consumed the sacrifice. From the fire arose the smoke and ascended into the heavens. One last time the smell of sacrifice filled the streets of Jerusalem. The sacrifice had been accepted because it was done in faith. To underscore this point Leviticus says that the burnt offering has a pleasing aroma to God. The smell of the animal burning on the open flame in the courtyard must have given off a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. It wasn’t just the aroma, but the sacrifice that pleased him.</p><p>The priests were merely mediators of forgiveness. The lamb was the substitute, and Joah was the recipient of forgiveness. In gratitude he lifted up his hands and cried out to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The priests began to clean up to prepare for their evening’s rest. However, Joah stayed until the entire sacrifice was consumed.</p><p>Joah was forgiven, but in the back of his mind he knew he would have to do it all over again. You see, this sacrifice, and the others like it would have to be offered over and over again. Just as Joah longed for forgiveness he ached for a time when something greater than the priesthood, something greater than the altar and the temple, something greater than King Solomon would come and complete the journey to forgiveness.</p><h2>The New Testament Offering</h2><p>Now we jump ahead some thirteen generations to this same place where Joah stood. This time we stand at Herod’s temple, Solomon’s temple had been destroyed.</p><p>It was a solemn procession in Jerusalem that day. The crowd watched as the Lamb of God was slowly led away. They had beaten and mocked him, they had scandalized his name, they had sentenced him to die on a cross in open shame.</p><p>The John the Baptist, who was the son of a Levitical priest, declared Jesus Christ to be the Lamb of God, the one without spot or blemish, in whose mouth was found no guile. The Romans and the Jews laid their hands on him, and He who knew no sin became sin that we might become the righteousness of God.</p><p>They led him to an altar, not one made of bronze, but one of wood. They nailed him altar thinking they were simply killing a blasphemer, and a rebel. Instead Jesus was the substitute for them, for Joah and for us. Like a lamb led to slaughter he opened not his mouth. They lifted Him up, and he bore our griefs, carried our sorrows, and took our affliction. Like Joah’s lamb he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, and his chastisement was for our peace. His wounds where the blood spilled brought about healing. The Covenant Lord of Israel laid on him the iniquity of us all. Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush Him (Isaiah 53:1-12).</p><p>Jesus was the High Priest presenting the offering. Jesus was the Lamb of God the innocent substitute offered on the altar as a sweet savor unto God. You and I are the recipients of God’s forgiveness and grace. It was our guilt and sin that was laid upon him.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.</p><p>But instead, those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year. For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. That is why, when Christ came into the world, he said to God,</p><p style="text-align: center"><em>“You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you have given me a body to offer.<br />You were not pleased with burnt offerings<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or other offerings for sin.<br />Then I said, ‘Look, I have come to do your will, O God—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as is written about me in the Scriptures.’”</em></p><p>First, Christ said, “You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them” (though they are required by the law of Moses). Then he said, “Look, I have come to do your will.” He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect. For God’s will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.</p><p>Under the old covenant, the priest stands and ministers before the altar day after day, offering the same sacrifices again and again, which can never take away sins. But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God’s right hand. There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet. For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy.<br />And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says,</p><p style="text-align: center"><em>“This is the new covenant I will make<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my people on that day, says the Lord:<br />I will put my laws in their hearts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will write them on their minds.”</em><br /><em>Then he says,</em><br /><em>“I will never again remember<br />their sins and lawless deeds.”</em></p><p>And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.</p><p>And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven’s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. By his death, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God’s house, let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him. For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ’s blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water. Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise. (Hebrews 10:1-23)</p><p>*<em>Preached at First Apostolic Church, January 21, 2018.

672	2018-01-18 14:28:50	\N	\N	\N	<p><em>The following post was contributed from the able pen of <a href="https://twitter.com/onenessapstlk">Reverend John Carroll</a>.</em></p><p><em>&#8220;But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect&#8221;</em> (1 Peter 3:15)</p><p>It will be my contention that the Apostolic movement needs to apologize to the world. There are many Pentecostal issues for which apologies are necessary. And I for one would like to participate in the process. I also hope that I can inspire other preachers (young and old) to become more apologetic to the world about what they believe.</p><p>Of course as many of you already suspect, I am using the various forms of apology in a nuanced, theological way. The Greek word is “<em>apologia</em>” and is found in 1 Peter 3:15. It is the Greek word that the <em>English Standard Version</em> translates as “<em>make a defense</em>.” Apologia is a Greek legal term that means to give a reasoned defense whether oral or written. It refers to an attorney providing a defense for his client’s actions. Or one may provide a defense of one’s self like Paul (Acts 22:1). In theology it refers to providing a reasoned defense for one’s doctrinal beliefs.</p><p>This post is an appeal for apologists. Apostolics need men and women who can give a reasoned defense for Christianity—as well as Pentecostal particulars. I want to discuss how we should go about doing this. There is an appropriate way to apologize. As we shall see in the following sections, we must apologize in a way that is Christ honoring.</p><h3><strong>Always Being Prepared to Make a Defense</strong></h3><p>Peter tells us to be “<em>prepared to make a defense</em>.” But we cannot make a reasoned defense until we understand the culture’s case. Getting ready to answer what may be asked of us from the culture demands that we anticipate and prepare. We must anticipate what they will be asking and prepare accordingly.</p><p>To anticipate what questions will be asked of us, we cannot live in a perpetual Pentecostal bubble. We must have a working knowledge of the world so we can properly engage it. While we are not <em>of </em>the world (John 17:16) we are <em>in</em> the world (John 17:11). Jesus compared our position within the world to his own (John 17:16). Furthermore, he suggested that what he did while he was in the world would could continue to be done in his absence and in his stead (John 14:12). What was Jesus’ level of involvement with the world while he was in the world? If we discover how Jesus lived in the world, then we can know how we are to live in the world. There are three possible ways to interact with the world around us:</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Isolation </strong></h4></li></ul><p>The first response to the world we will call isolation. Isolation is the tendency of many holiness-minded Apostolics. Isolationism places a strong emphasis on the biblical motif of separation. They take separation to mean that we should avoid contact with the world. While I consider myself a strong advocate of scriptural separation, I reject an isolationist approach to living in the world. The two metaphors (light and salt) that Christ used of Christians will not allow us to be isolationists. Do not allow the Pharisees of our day to conflate separation with isolation. The two are not synonymous.</p><p>If light refuses to go into the darkness, then light will not do what light is intended to do. The purpose of light is to dispel darkness, but it has to “shine as lights <em>in</em> the world” (Philippians 2:15). And if salt doesn’t touch what needs preservation then it can never delay the decay. If salt remains in its box, then it may as well not be salt. As long as salt is isolated the putrefaction will prevail. If, as the salt of the world, we remain in our church boxes then we will be ineffective. Light must engage the darkness, and salt must engage the decay. Isolation is not the answer!</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Assimilation </strong></h4></li></ul><p>The second possible response to the world is assimilation. To become like them; to live like they live. This, too, is a not a biblical option. The Bible clearly calls us to separation (2 Corinthians 6:17). As Christians we are to live lives of holiness (1 Peter 1:16). So the Christians should neither isolate nor assimilate. So how are we to live in the world?</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Insulation</strong></h4></li></ul><p>God’s plan for Christians in the culture is not to isolate nor assimilate, but to insulate. We are not to isolate from the world, assimilate to the world, but we are to insulate in the world. This is where separation becomes salt and light. It is only in the world that separate becomes the effective contrast that Christ intends for it to be. Notice Jesus’ analogy of how Christians survive in culture:</p><p style="text-align: center;">“Behold, I am sending you out as sheep <em>in the midst</em> of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves” (Matthew 10:16).</p><p>Notice the two things that Jesus does not tell the disciples. He does not tell them to stay away from wolves. He does not tell them to blend with the wolves. But they are to be as sheep in the midst of the wolves therefore they are to be wise and harmless. Jesus is the ultimate example of not being <em>of</em> this world. He was the living bread from heaven (John 6:51). Even though he was not <em>of</em> this world, he came <em>into</em> the world to save sinners. And because he came to save sinners, he engaged sinners on their level (tax collectors, sinners, etc).</p><h3><strong>How Then Shall We Respond?<br /></strong></h3><p>By engaging the culture, we become aware of their questions and concerns about God. Based on this information, we can begin to prepare our response to the culture’s questions. Isolationists never engage and so they never understand the questions so they cannot provide the answer. The assimilationists don’t think the answer is really that important. The insulationists know how important their questions are, and how important our answers are, and see taking the answer to them as our mission. So we insulate ourselves by the Spirit and the Word and we go wherever we must to share the gospel.</p><p>I believe that the Apostolic doctrine gets the most right about theology and Christian living—at least in theory. We need men and women who are willing to engage the culture with an a efficient working knowledge of the culture that prompt us to prepare to provide adequate answers to their questions.</p><h3><strong>To Anyone</strong></h3><p>Who should be the object of our apology? The answer is, to anyone. To be able to make a defense “to anyone” we need to have a broad working knowledge of the cultural issues. Let’s narrow the focus just a little bit. How about instead of going crazy trying to master ever possible opposing worldview we get a good geographical understanding of the world in which we live? What are the dominate worldviews and religions in our world where God has called us to evangelize—or apologize? What are the most likely concepts that you will face daily on your job? Begin with those and go from there. This is great advice for laypersons. However, we preachers may need to have a broader working knowledge of theology and other disciplines.</p><h3><strong>Who Asks You for a Reason for the Hope</strong></h3><p>According to Peter, we are not to go about giving reasons to people who haven’t asked. This is what I will term, “<em>passive apologetics</em>.” While we are in the passive portion of apologetics, there is something that we can do all the time. Peter told us to, “sanctify the Lord God in your hearts” (KJV). This personal sanctification is part of the preparation. I don’t have the time to talk about reverse sanctification. Normally it is Jesus by his Holy Spirit who is sanctifying us. But in this text we are to sanctify the Lord. But this prepares us for the next step.</p><p>We are to be prepared to make a defense to anyone who “asks us” for a reason of our hope. We are not to be the obnoxious Christian protestor that lobbies to shut down all the local bars. We are not to model Westboro Baptist and their hateful mantra. We are to embody “peaceable and quiet” lives (1 Timothy 2:2). We are to live quietly and ready. And when someone has a question about our lives then we can give a reasoned defense.</p><p>I like to use the phrase, “<em>living a questionable lifestyle</em>.” When is the last time your life has led to a question from an unbeliever? We must live in such a way as salt in the earth that it creates a thirst in the hearts of sinners to know the Lord that we have sanctified in our hearts.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The conclusion of the whole matter is live in a good way that makes people ask questions about your Christianity. Engage the world; don’t hide from it. Sanctify the Lord in your heart so that through your apology he may sanctify others to himself.</p><p>How do we live in the world? We live apologetically. When we are confronted with the same-sex agenda, we apologize. When we are faced with atheism, we apologize. When we are faced with secularism, we apologize. We must stop living in our Apostolic bubbles and start apologizing to the world for what we believe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/jcccentralcom">Rev.

674	2017-11-27 18:47:42	\N	\N	\N	<p>As 2017 draws to a climax it is time for a review of my top books from the year. Its difficult for me to cull down my list to just ten books, because I&#8217;ve read several outstanding works this year. Not all of the books were published in 2017, its just that I&#8217;ve read them this year. Either way, these are some of the books that had a great impact on me in 2017.</p><ol><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Bible-Supernaturally-Savoring-Scripture-ebook/dp/B06XFZ648G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509848756&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=reading+the+bible+supernaturally">Reading the Bible Supernaturally</a></strong> by <em>John Piper</em>. Last year my number one book was Piper&#8217;s A Peculiar Glory, which was the first installment of this trilogy on the topic of Scripture. This second installment was even better than the first. Whereas A Peculiar Glory was an introduction to the doctrine of Scripture, in this book Piper offers insight in how God opens our eyes to understand and apply Scripture.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1433551934/ref=x_gr_w_glide_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_glide_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1433551934&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">Parenting: 14 Gospel Principles That Can Radically Change Your Family</a></strong> by <em>Paul David Tripp</em>. I am a father of a two year-old little girl. Parenting is still very new me, and as my little girls continues to grow the challenges increase each day. I believe my family is my first responsibility as a man. My wife and daughter are counting on me to lead and guide them, and this book radically helped me. If you haven&#8217;t read Tripp I highly recommend that you do. This is not just about parenting, this is a book that is baptized in the gospel. Tripp&#8217;s parallels between the Law and Grace in our salvation and then how those same principles are applied in parenting is some of the best I&#8217;ve read. Read this book if you are a new parent, a soon to be parent, or a veteran parent, the principles are worthy of your time.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1629952486/ref=x_gr_w_glide_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_glide_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1629952486&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">How to Understand and Apply the New Testament: Twelve Steps from Exegesis to Theology</a></strong> by <em>Andrew David Naselli</em>. This is more or less a textbook on how to interpret the New Testament. However, this is not your grandfather&#8217;s hermeneutics textbook. Naselli is a fine writer who does a great job of communicating how to properly interpret Scripture. I absolutely devoured this book in just a few sittings, and there is hardly a page that isn&#8217;t highlighted and annotated. A great introduction to the world of hermeneutics and exegesis.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NIV-Zondervan-Study-Bible-eBook-ebook/dp/B00VPSWIGA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509997436&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=zondervan+niv+study+bible">The NIV Zondervan Study Bible</a></strong> edited by <em>D.A. Carson</em>. While working on my Biblical Studies degree through Indiana Wesleyan University it was required that we used the New International Version Bible. I mostly use the English Standard Version, King James Version or New American Standard Version for reading and studying. Working on my bachelor&#8217;s degree gave me the opportunity to use this translation. I picked up this particular study bible and was blown away. Now, whatever you think of the NIV translation is of little concern to me, but the book introductions, notes, and articles are absolutely outstanding. I have three copies: one for my office, one at the house, and a digital copy. It&#8217;s that good! The ESV Study Bible is still my favorite study bible, but the Zondervan Study Bible edited by D.A. Carson is right on the ESV&#8217;s heels. This does use the 2011 edition of the NIV, which I really like. But again, the notes and articles are worth the price of the Bible.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CW67XW/ref=x_gr_w_glide?caller=Goodreads&amp;callerLink=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9182576-lessons-from-a-third-grade-dropout&amp;tag=x_gr_w_glide-20">Lessons From a Third Grade Dropout</a></strong> by <em>Rick Rigsby</em>. I watched a clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg_Q7KYWG1g">Rigsby&#8217;s commencement speech</a> on the same topic on YouTube and was blown away, so I of course quickly downloaded his book. Rick Rigsby tells of the influence that his father, who was a third grade dropout, had on him. This is the kind of book I want to give to people who want to change, mature, and grow as a person and Christian. These are old and proven principles that will transform your attitude and life.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Finish-Give-Yourself-Gift-Done-ebook/dp/B01N4VVT1Z/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509995889&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=finish+jon+acuff">Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done</a></strong> by <em>Jon Acuff</em>. I&#8217;ve got a few go-to motivational books that I read when I need a swift kick in the backside. Steven Pressfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B007A4SDCG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509996010&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+war+of+art+steven+pressfield">The War of Art</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B00NK0MJBK/ref=pd_sim_351_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=18008J70KNFAPSGSTA9S">Do the Work</a> are two standards on my digital bookshelf. I needed some new motivation that was the same message. That&#8217;s where Acuff&#8217;s Finish comes in. I am really good at starting projects, but rather mediocre when it comes to finishing. This blog was kind of like that. I had a lot good ideas but wasn&#8217;t finishing them. After reading Acuff&#8217;s book I&#8217;ve kicked my production into high gear and have seen great results. Acuff is a very good writer, one that will make you laugh as he motivates you to finish your work. A needed book at a needed time for me.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Your-Phone-Changing-You-ebook/dp/B01N6371LN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511806334&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+ways+your+phone+is+changing+you+by+tony+reinke">Twelve Ways Your Phone is Changing You</a></strong> by <em>Tony Reinke</em>. Some books come at just the right time, and this one by Tony Reinke came at just the right time for me. Reinke is an editor and creator at <a href="http://desiringgod.com">DesiringGod.com</a>, and he seems to always have his finger on the pulse of the culture and Christianity. There is no denying that we as a people are addicted to our smartphones and social media. Reinke is very even handed in showing the obstacles and opportunities with our smartphones. This should definitely be on your reading list.</li><li><strong><a href="http://medorachurch.com/">The Ephesians Letter</a></strong> by <em>M.L. Walls</em>. I bought some tools when I purchased my house a few years ago. Granted, I don&#8217;t know how to use most of those tools perfectly, but I do have them when I need them. My books are my tools, and sometimes I buy books knowing that they might serve a purpose later. I bought this commentary on Ephesians many years ago. Recently I was working on a sermon concerning the believer&#8217;s warfare, so I pulled this commentary off of my shelf. I ended up reading the entire commentary in about a week&#8217;s time. Bishop Walls is the consummate bible preacher and scholar. This is a very accessible commentary that will enrich your devotional life, and sermon preparation. You can contact the church on how you can purchase this commentary and many of the other works of Bishop Walls.

Lawson doesn&#8217;t hold back many punches in revealing what it takes to faithfully be a follower of Jesus Christ. Lawson&#8217;s exposition of Luke 14:25-35 is outstanding. The message of the book is wonderful, but it is also a prime example of faithful biblical exposition.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BU6F7RI/ref=x_gr_w_glide?caller=Goodreads&amp;callerLink=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29921966-none-like-him&amp;tag=x_gr_w_glide-20">None Like Him: 10 Ways God is Different From Us and Why That&#8217;s a Good Thing</a></strong> by <em>Jen Wilken</em>. Last school year I taught our high school students about the attributes of God. When I came across Wilken&#8217;s book I immediately grabbed it. This is a short, but very succinct introduction to God&#8217;s attributes. Wilken&#8217;s writing is engaging and insightful.

675	2017-11-15 12:18:58	\N	\N	\N	<p>A friend loves at all times (Proverbs 17:17)</p><p>Friendship is an important topic in Scripture. Abraham was considered the friend of God (Isa. 41:8; Jam. 2:23). The Lord spoke with Moses face to face as friends would (Ex. 33:11). David and Jonathan were very close friends (1 Sam. 18:1-4). Jesus considered the disciples to be His friends (Jn. 15:15). Jesus’ enemies reviled Him because he was friends to publicans and sinners (Mt. 11:19).</p><p>Young men need to know the value of friendship. The wise man knows how to choose good friends, and in turn knows how to be a good friend. This is where Proverbs yields many important lessons about friendships.</p><p>In this study we will look at choosing friends, being a good friend and how to be a bad friend.</p><h2>Choosing Friends</h2><p>“Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm” (Pro. 13:20).</p><p>Young men must be wise in their selection of their friends. Choosing the correct friends may be some of the most important decisions that young men make. The old saying goes “show me your friends and I will show you your future.” Surrounding yourself with the wrong type of people may have detrimental consequences.</p><p>The proverb says “whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.” The company you keep influences your life and your destiny. Someone once said, “You can’t soar with eagles if you walk with turkeys.” Males of all ages have the inherit ability to want to hang out with turkeys. If you are going to be wise, then you need to hang out with wise people. If you want to know how manage money, then surround yourself with people who have some. If your goal is to excel in school, then you can’t hang out with loafers and losers. If you desire to be spiritual, then you will not want to hang out with carnally-minded friends.</p><p>You will suffer harm when you fellowship with fools. The New Living Translation records it like this: “associate with fools and get in trouble.” Friends who are always getting themselves into trouble will more than likely get you into trouble too. It’s not a good idea to run with troublemakers and instigators. Your reputation will be vulnerable to scrutiny simply by joining up with fools. It is difficult to live wisely if you fraternize with foolish friends.</p><p>Now, the selection of friends has nothing to do with social standing, economic status, or ethnicity. The choosing of friends has to do with morality and influence. Wise young men will not choose friends based upon someone’s wealth or lack of wealth, or the color of their skin. Selection of friends is not based upon if that person can make you more popular. And it is not contingent on what that person can give you, or what they can do for you.</p><h2>How to be a Good Friend</h2><p>“<em>A friend loves at all times</em>” (Pro. 17:17).</p><p>Choosing your friends is important, but you must also know the qualities of being a good friend. “A man who has friends must himself be friendly” (Pro. 18:24 NKJV). Being friendly is a necessary attribute if you are going have friends. I have known too many people whose personality and attitude hinders their ability to have any friends. Instead of being friendly, they are like fingernails on a chalkboard, and nobody wants to be around such a person.</p><p>In order for you to have friends, then you need to know the characteristics of being a good friend.</p><p><strong>Faithfulness</strong>: “<em>Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful friend who can find</em>” (Pro. 20:6)? Faithfulness means being loyal. A good friend is always there. They seem to always have your back. Many people want friends, but not many want to be faithful. When you stumble and fall a good friend will be there to pick you up (Ecc. 4:10).</p><p><strong>Insightful</strong>: “<em>Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another</em>” (Pro. 27:17). A good friend makes his companions better. I’m thankful for my closest friends, who have been my best friends since childhood, they made me better. They were always willing to give wise advice and keep me in check. If you are going to be a good friend, then you will sharpen your friends, and they will sharpen you. Friendships should make all parties better. This does not give you license to nag your friends and attempt to mold them into your personal image. No, you are sharpening each other into Christ’s image. Don’t surround yourself with “yes men” either. Young men need others who will make them better, who will push them to succeed and excel.</p><p><strong>Loving</strong>: “<em>A friend loves at all times</em>” (Pro. 17:17). True friends are those who have seen you at your worst and still love you. Genuine friends will stick closer than a brother (Pro. 18:24). Authentic friends won’t leave you in the hard times. They won’t be like Job’s miserable friends who were critical during their friend’s crisis. In order for you to be a good friend, then you must exemplify love. Love is one of, if not the greatest, attributes of friendship.</p><p>Jesus is the ultimate example of a good friend. Christ has seen us in our most vulnerable, broken, and tragic times and He still loves us. There has not been a friend who has been more faithful than Jesus.</p><h2>How to be a Bad Friend</h2><p>The antithesis of being a good friend is being a bad friend. Hopefully no one chooses to be a bad friend. However, there are some characteristics of being bad friend that young men should avoid. Just as scripture records good friends, it also records bad friends. Amnon had a friend who gave some awful advice (2 Sam. 13:3). David had a friend who betrayed him at the worst possible time (2 Sam. 15:12; Ps. 41:9; 55:12-14). Then the worst of friends was Judas who sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (Mk. 14:10).</p><p>If you don’t want to be a good friend, then here are a few attributes of how to be a bad friend.</p><p><strong>Always Fight</strong>: “<em>It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling</em>” (Pro. 20:3). This is how you can become a person that no one wants to be around: be disagreeable, quarrel, squabble, quibble, argue, fuss, or bicker. This is a fireproof method of being a bad friend. The young man who is always wanting to disagree for the sake of playing the devil’s advocate will wear out his welcome. Taking the opposite opinion just to get on people’s nerves and to get attention will cause you to be a fool in the eyes of your companions. Children love to jump into puddles, but wise young men avoid puddles and keep others away from them. The fool willing jumps into every conversation and argument he can find.</p><p><strong>Lose Your Cool</strong>: “<em>A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger quiets contention</em>” (Pro. 15:18). We all know the one guy who is always ready to fight. Unfortunately this antagonist will also fight his friends at the drop of a hat. If you can’t keep your cool, then you won’t be able to keep your friends. The young man who cannot control his temper is like a city with broken down walls (Pro. 25:28). Hot-tempered friends may serve as entertainment from time to time, but when their anger turns towards you, or gets you into nefarious situations it will no longer be entertaining. Make no friendship with a man given to anger, and do not be one who is given to anger (Pro. 22:24-25).</p><p><strong>Be a Gossip</strong>: “<em>A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends</em>” (Pro. 16:28). Within the confines of friendship secrets are shared. However, if you want to be a bad friend then you will go and tell all that you know to others. Vulnerability is part of the friendship relationship. We bear each others burdens. The wise young man will be the Fort Knox of his friend’s secrets and weaknesses. “Whoever would foster love covers over an offense, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends” (Proverbs 17:9 NIV). When a friend offends you it is not wise to go and tell everyone. Keep offenses between you and your friend. Things are made worse when you begin to gossip and publicize your offenses.</p><p>It would be profitable for you to read Proverbs and write down all the wonderful advice it yields concerning friendship. Being a good friend isn’t a sign of weakness or frailty. On the contrary, it is biblical and spiritual for a young man to have friendships, and to pursue being a good friend.</p><p><em>This post is part on an ongoing series entitled</em>: <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2017/10/25/wisdom-for-young-men/">Wisdom for Young Men</a></p>	100	\N	The Friend	\N

For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few (Matthew 7:13–14).</p><p>Towards the end of His Sermon on the Mount Jesus gives his listeners two gates (or doors), and two ways that they can enter. The choice is laid out before his audience, and they are to choose which gate to walk through.</p><p>The two gates lead to two ways. The gate that is wide leads to the way that is broad. The gate that is narrow, which is small, leads to the way that is narrow.</p><h1>The Wide Gate</h1><p>“<em>For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many</em>” (v. 13)</p><p>Jesus gives the details of the wide gate:</p><ul><li>The wide gate is wide</li><li>The wide gate is easy</li><li>The wide gate is found by many</li><li>The wide gate leads to destruction</li></ul><h2>The Wide Gate is Wide</h2><p>Unlike the narrow gate, this is a wide gate. Jesus said “<em>many</em>” enter into it. The masses fit through the wide gate. The many include pagans, atheists, humanists, the unrighteous, the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who practice homosexuality, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, and swindlers. Paul would say, &#8220;such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:9-11).</p><p>The wide gate and the broad way are filled with peer pressured friends, and the easily influenced. It is filled with those who bow to social coercion, who would rather fold under pressure than stand out for righteousness. The wide gate is filled with “shouldas,” “couldas,” and “wouldas.” The gate is packed with the procrastinators, youthful loafers, excuse givers and finger pointers.</p><h2>The Wide Gate is Easy</h2><p>The wide gate is easy too. It is the attractive route. The wide gate is inclusive, tolerant, and permissive. It loved by the self-oriented and the self-indulgent. The lovers of self more than lovers of God enter through the wide gate. Those who love to have their ears tickled with the false doctrine of man&#8217;s goodness will have full access to the wide gate.</p><p>The wide gate has no laws, rules, principles, precepts or commandments. Everyone does what is right in their own eyes (Jud. 21:25). It is the way that seems right unto man but its end leads to death (Pro. 14:12). It’s the gate where sin is tolerated and righteousness is repudiated.</p><h2>The Wide Gate is Found by Many</h2><p>Where are the crowds, and the masses found? At the wide gate. Where are the popular, fashionable, celebrated, and the mainstream located? On the wide path. Those who enter in the wide gate go in by the mobs. The easy route is always more desirable to the hordes. Jesus said &#8220;many&#8221; find the wide gate. What a sad reality that many will be led astray by self-deception, seduction, feelings, and sin.</p><h2>The Wide Gate Leads to Destruction</h2><p>Unfortunately the wide gate leads to the broad path that ends in destruction. This does not just mean extinction or annihilation. Rather is means total ruin and loss in this life as well. It is not just the complete loss of being, but the destruction of well-being. The literal definition of the Greek word for <em>destruction</em> means the termination of something by causing so much damage to it that it cannot be repaired or no longer exists.</p><p>It is the destination of the evil, wicked, ungodly and all sinners. Its the destination of perdition, hell and everlasting torment. Jesus did not mince His words when describing the wide gate and broad path.</p><h1>The Narrow Gate</h1><p>“<em>Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few</em>.”</p><p>Jesus contrasts the wide gate and broad path with the narrow gate and the narrow path.</p><p>The narrow way is not so much a <em>what</em> as it is a <em>who</em>: Jesus Christ. It’s not so much a <em>path</em> as much as it is a <em>person</em>: Jesus Christ. Jesus said that he was the Way, the Truth and the Life, and no one could come unto the Father except through Him (Jn. 14:6). It was also the Lord Jesus Christ who said, “I am the Door” (Jn. 10:9-16). And it was Jesus who said that we should “enter by the narrow gate” (Mt. 7:13a). In essence Jesus was pointing to Himself as the way to eternal life.</p><ul><li>The narrow gate is narrow</li><li>The narrow gate is hard</li><li>The narrow gate is only found by a few</li><li>The narrow gate leads to life</li></ul><h2>The Narrow Gate is Narrow</h2><p>The narrow gate is small, restricted, compressed and cramped. The root word in the Greek means “to groan.” The narrow gate can only be entered individually and not by groups. You must make the decision on your own. You cannot enter in through by hanging onto the coattails of someone else, you cannot sneak in, or follow the leading of the crowd.</p><p>The Jews believed they would be saved as a nation because they were racially and genetically connected to Abraham (Jn. 8:39). But Jesus told of a salvation that each individual must be born again of the water and the Spirit (Jn. 3:3-15). You will not be saved because someone else in your family was saved. Just because your parents and grandparents came to faith in Jesus Christ, that does not make you an heir of salvation. God does not have grandchildren, He only has children who have been adopted by Christ and born again.</p><h2>The Narrow Gate is Hard</h2><p>The narrow gate is hard because:</p><ul><li>Its not popular, fashionable, or trendy.</li><li>Its the path of self-denial and the cross.</li><li>Its the path of sacrifice.</li><li>Its the path of the cross.</li><li>Its the path of separation.</li><li>Its the path of holiness, godliness and righteousness.</li><li>Its the path of repentance.</li><li>Its the path of walking in the spirit and not in the flesh.</li><li>Its the path of loving God, your neighbor, and enemies.</li></ul><h2>The Narrow Gate is Only Found by a Few</h2><p>Believers are not few in number because the gate is too narrow, or too small to accommodate more. There is no limit to God’s love and mercy. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that <em>whosoever</em> believes may have eternal life (Jn. 3:16). It’s not God’s will that any should perish but that <em>all</em> would come to repentance (2 Pt. 3:9). The renowned American evangelist, DL Moody, wrote, “<em>The elect are the whosoever wills and the non-elect are the whosoever won’t.”</em></p><h2>The Narrow Gate Leads to Life</h2><p>Jesus emphasized that He was the Life (Jn. 14:6). This narrow way through Jesus Christ you will find everlasting life. The narrow gate and the narrow path promises hope, joy, peace, happiness and satisfaction. It is a quality of life that is only found in Jesus Christ.</p><ul><li>Its peace that passes all understanding (Phil. 4:7)</li><li>Its joy unspeakable and full of glory (1 Pt. 1:8)</li><li>Its rejoicing in the midst of sorrow (Phil. 2:28)</li><li>Its love within a community of believers (1 Jn. 3:16)</li><li>Its hope beyond tomorrow (1 Cor. 15:19)</li><li>Its gladness (Ps. 45:7)</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, which gate and which path will you choose? This is not a guessing game wondering what lies behind each door. Jesus made it clear: one gate leads to destruction, the other leads to life. Which will you choose?</p>	100	\N	Two Gates and Two Paths	\N	
677	2017-11-08 18:15:43	\N	\N	\N	<p>Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves (Matthew 10:16).</p><p>Jesus never shied away from telling His disciples of the dangers they were going to face as His ambassadors. Such realities would happen after Christ’s resurrection and ascension. They faced devils and sicknesses when they were sent out two by two during Jesus’ earthly ministry. (Mk. 6:7-13). But after Pentecost the disciples were going to be faced with new opposition and be greeted by new enemies of the gospel. In spite of these dangers the disciples would be equipped by the Holy Spirit, and with the abiding presence of Jesus Christ (Mt. 28:20).</p><p>Modern believers are faced with many of the same challenges of the first church. Our adversaries may not be Jewish leaders and Roman overlords, but they are just as dangerous. As the culture and world grow darker by the hour, the Christian must heed the advice of Jesus if we are going to be able to navigate the dangerous terrain of our world.</p><h2>Behold, I Am Sending You</h2><p>Jesus begins with, “Behold.” This indicates that Jesus wanted His disciple’s undivided attention. The Greek word for behold was used to liven up a Hebrew style narrative. It was a word used to get people’s attention. Jesus was about to give some serious instructions, and He didn’t want His disciples to miss the significance. Brothers and sisters, we should be very attentive to what the Spirit is saying to the church today. Our ears should be tuned to the Spirit, and our hearts should be sensitized to the need of the hour.</p><p>Next Jesus states, “I am sending you out.” The disciples were not going out on their own accord. First of all, no one with common sense willing goes out into dangerous territory. People usually don’t put themselves in harm’s way, especially if it entails scorn, mistreatment, loss of reputation and sacrificing popularity. I am sure the disciples would have chosen to do the easy task, much like all of us prefer.</p><p>This is why it is imperative that you know you are called of God, and not of yourself. Going out and doing something you are not called to do leaves you without the spiritual protection that is needed. The seven sons of Sceva were such men. They entangled themselves with a demonic oppressed individual and were overpowered (Acts 19:13-16).</p><h2>In the Midst of Wolves</h2><p>Jesus was sending the disciples out to the wolves. In Palestine, wolves were the most common natural enemy of sheep. They roamed the hills and valleys, looking for a sheep that strayed away from the flock or lagged behind. When a wolf found such a sheep it quickly attacked and tore it to pieces. Even a grown, healthy sheep was utterly defenseless against a wolf. Wolves are known for being merciless and ferocious (Ezek. 22:27).</p><p>Christians are commissioned to go into the wolves’ territory. We are called to rescue the prey from the devourer. Such a mission is dangerous and critical. No doubt the church is dealing with many precarious situations. Darkness and evil are prevalent in every community whether you are in the suburbs or the metropolis. The culture is growing more tolerant of wickedness and growing more intolerant of righteousness. Just as Nero blamed the Christians for burning down Rome, which began some of the worst Christian persecution in history, the modern culture is waiting for the right opportunity to cast the blame of any event on Christians. We should be warned that Christian persecution is at our doorstep, and the wolves’ appetite is increasing.</p><h2>Dependent Sheep</h2><p>Jesus likened the disciples to sheep. The natural enemy of the sheep is the wolf. Sheep are considered the prey of wolves. Sheep are defenseless without a shepherd. Sheep do not have claws or sharp teeth, nor do they have any hard covering on their body to protect them. They are meek and rely on their shepherd to protect and keep them from harm.</p><p>Sheep are dependent upon their shepherd. The shepherd leads them through the rough contours. Lovingly the shepherd prods the sheep to stay with the flock on the right path. The shepherd protects against enemies and danger. Without the shepherd they vulnerable to predators.</p><p>The Christian is dependent upon Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (Jn. 10:11). You and I are nothing without Christ. Everyday we are dependent upon his guidance, provision and protection. Every obstacle, problem and issue needs the instruction of the Good Shepherd. The Christian must recognize her own deficiencies, casting all of her care upon Christ because He cares (1 Pt. 3:5). To maneuver through the delicate conditions of each situation it is critical to depend on God’s wisdom and power</p><h2>Wise Serpents</h2><p>How were the disciples to handle such perilous conditions? Jesus said they were to be as wise as serpents. In Egyptian hieroglyphics and Ancient Near East lore the serpent was considered wise. Serpents represented cunning, craftiness, and caution. Serpents were thought of as subtile and shrewd.</p><p>To handle opponents and opposition the disciples needed to have the characteristics of being as wise as serpents. Along with being dependent upon the Shepherd, they were to handle situations with shrewdness and caution. Paul told the Colossians to conduct themselves with wisdom towards outsiders (Col. 4:5). James wrote that if any man lacks wisdom he should pray to receive it from God (Jam. 1:5). Of course God is willing to give wisdom to those who ask in faith.</p><p>With such chaos and confusion in this world it calls for godly people to be endowed with wisdom. This isn’t just knowledge and information, but it is the application of knowing what to do and when to do it. Wisdom is also about knowing what to say and knowing when not to say it. Our counsel must be baptized with wisdom, and immersed with prudence. The book Proverbs is replete with advice on how one should take caution with the words they speak. Jesus even said that the Holy Spirit would teach the disciples what to say during turbulent times (Lk. 12:12; Jn. 14:26).</p><h2>Harmless Doves</h2><p>The disciples were to be wise as serpents and to be as harmless like doves. Notice that Jesus does not tell them that they should take the defensive posture of a serpent, ready to attack. No, Jesus wants the disciples to be wise and harmless. The wise Christian is gentle. The spirit-filled individual will be taught what to say by the Holy Spirit, and be as gentle as the Holy Spirit. Perhaps this is why the imagery of the dove is used in connection with the Holy Spirit (Jn. 1:32). We should note that gentleness is a fruit of being filled with the Spirit (Gal. 5:23).</p><p>Delicacy is necessary for many of the situations that believers find themselves in. People’s hurt, and brokenness that proceeds from the original fall of humanity, requires gentleness. Being sensitive to people’s problems isn’t evidence of compromise, but instead demonstrates compassion. And this world definitely needs more compassion with the truth that we preach (Eph. 4:15).</p><p>Instead of avoiding the conflicts that the church is being confronted with, we should equip ourselves with the instructions of Jesus Christ. The wolves of our communities may never become extinct. However, we can be dependent as sheep, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.</p>	100	\N	Dependent Sheep, Wise Serpents and Harmless Doves	\N	/stage-7-photography-1231475-unsplash.jpg
678	2017-11-04 19:06:00	\N	\N	\N	<p>Proverbs was written to give wisdom and instruction (Pro. 1:1-7). The proverbs that were compiled into this amazing book were written so that its readers would become wise, and skillful in living. To reject the teaching of wisdom and instruction in this book is to be a fool: “fools despise wisdom and instruction” (Pro. 1:7).</p><h2>The Fool</h2><p>The book of Proverbs uses the words fool, fools, and foolish at least sixty-nine times in the English Standard Version. However, the foolish man theme is found in at least one hundred places in Proverbs. The book of Proverbs is not just about becoming wise, it is also about not becoming a fool. There are a myriad of admonishments for wise living, but on the other hand the writer places just as much emphasis on forsaking foolishness. Young men are given to foolishness, their lack of maturity gives them a bent towards folly. But the father writing the proverbs urges his young son to pursue wisdom and to turn from folly. Wisdom isn’t just about growing in knowledge, and information. Wisdom is applying what you have learned. But what we see in Proverbs is that the fool despises wisdom and instruction. The fool does not seek knowledge, and therefore does not desire to apply it. By failing to pursue wisdom and instruction he finds destruction. The word “fool” in the Hebrew is defined as being thick headed and stubborn. A young man who will not grow in wisdom is a thick-headed fool.</p><p>In this lesson we take a look at ten characteristics of the foolish man.</p><h2>Ten Characteristics of the Foolish Man</h2><p><strong>The Fool is a Skeptic:</strong> <em>“The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no god’”</em> (Ps. 14:1). This is perhaps one of the more well-known scriptures concerning the fool. Atheism is on the rise across our country. This foolish concept is being peddled in public schools and universities. Young men need to know the basic doctrines of God’s existence. Theology isn’t just for ministers and seminarians, but it is crucial for all young men that they may give an answer for the hope that is within them (1 Pt. 3:15). Without a fundamental knowledge and understanding of the existence of God, then you will not be able to comprehend the fear of the Lord, which leads to wisdom.</p><p><strong>The Fool Doesn’t Fear the Lord:</strong> <em>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction”</em> (Pro. 1:7). Fools disdain wisdom and instruction. The fool who believes there is no God, will not fear that God. By rejecting the truth of God’s existence the fool rejects the wisdom and instruction that comes from God. The height of folly is to not fear falling into the hands of the living God (Heb. 10:31).</p><p><strong>The Fool is Always Right:</strong> <em>“The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listen to advice”</em> (Pro. 12:15). Reasonable people will take correction and learn from their mistakes and shortcomings. On the other hand the fool rejects such advice. The foolish man believes that he is always right and everyone else is always wrong. You cannot be a blessed Christian without being corrected (Pro. 3:12; 2 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 12:6).</p><p><strong>The Fool is Reckless and Careless:</strong> <em>“One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is reckless and careless”</em> (Pro. 14:16). A wise young man will be cautious about his behavior and will seek to avoid evil. But the fool willingly throws caution to the wind following his desires and lusts. The wise man weighs the consequences of the choices laid before him, while the fool is careless in his decision making.</p><p><strong>The Fool is Unteachable:</strong> <em>“A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only expressing his opinion”</em> (Pro. 18:2). To not have any regard for learning, or growing in knowledge is foolishness. Young men who never read Scripture, or who are always distracted during the preaching of God’s Word will undoubtedly fail at spiritual matters. The young man who tunes out instruction from parents, teachers, and leaders is nothing but a fool. He is like a man on a journey without a destination and a map. He will continuously wander never finding refuge. Young men who will sit at the feet of the wise, and who will glean from their wisdom will be prosperous in all they do.</p><p><strong>The Fool Speaks Foolishly:</strong> <em>“The heart of fools proclaim folly”</em> (Pro. 12:23b). Considering that a fool is unteachable, he then will not have anything of value to speak. The fool values his own opinion. Instead of listening while others speak he is simply abiding his time until he gets to speak again. What comes from his mouth is folly, it is the opposite of wisdom. The fool’s heart is void of wisdom, and what is in his heart will spill from his mouth (Prov. 4:23; Lk. 6:45). Remember, the fool says in his heart there is no God (Ps. 14:1). A man whose heart does not house the Spirit of God is subject to the foolishness of his spiritual emptiness.</p><p><strong>The Fool Returns to His Sin:</strong> <em>“Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly”</em> (Pro. 26:11). Young men who do not forsake their sin are like the dog that returns to his vomit. He returns to what previously made him sick. The gall of guilt should be enough for us to not return to our sin. It should be a reminder that it made us weak and vulnerable to condemnation and shame. The fool does not remember that it once made him sick, but instead returns to partake of it again. Let us turn from our wicked ways to never return!</p><p><strong>The Fool Lacks Self-Control:</strong> <em>“A man of quick temper acts foolishly, and a man of evil devices is hated”</em> (Pro. 14:17). Young men often times want to showoff their strength and courage, and in doing so they reveal how weak they are. True strength is being able to control yourself rather than be controlled by circumstance and situation. The young man will be a slave to his emotions, and temper if he does not learn self-restraint. A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls (Pro. 25:28). When you can’t control yourself you’re no better than a city without walls to protect it. You will open yourself up to all sorts of folly. Better to be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger (Jam. 1:19).</p><p><strong>The Fool is Contentious:</strong> <em>“A fool’s lips walk into a fight, and his mouth invited a beating”</em> (Pro. 18:6). The young man who can’t control his emotions, probably doesn’t have the resolve to control his tongue either. Our tongues are a strong muscle, and wise is the man who learns to control it. A fool will attend every argument he is invited, or not invited to. The amount of foolish arguing that takes place through social media is a cause of concern. You win one hundred percent of the arguments you don’t get involved with.</p><p><strong>The Fool Mocks Sin:</strong> <em>“Fools make a mock at sin”</em> (Pro. 14:9 KJV). How many young men mock and scorn the church? Too often young men are drawn to the rebels who believe Christianity is nothing more than a cosmic killjoy. Just as these fools shun the responsibility of forsaking sin, wise men shouldn’t give them audience. Those who mock God’s wisdom, will one day be mocked by God while they are in their calamity (Pro. 1:24-26).</p><p>There are many more characteristics of the fool found in the book of Proverbs. Young men should heed to the many warnings of foolish living. Proverbs doesn’t paint a pretty picture of the outcome of being a fool.

687	2017-07-11 17:16:04	\N	\N	\N	<p>In this episode we continue the Preaching Lab series.</p><p><strong>Step One:</strong> <em>Pray</em>. Seek the Lord for guidance for the best topic on which to preach about. Saturate your study and preparation with prayer. Without the anointing we might as well not even attempt to preach.</p><p><strong>Step Two</strong>: <em>Select a Text</em>. Our assignment was to preach a youth class or youth aged service. All of Scripture needs to be preached, but it is important to know what you are going to preach from Scripture. Keep your audience, setting, environment and culture in mind as you select the text.</p><p><strong>Step Three</strong>: <em>Consider the Scripture</em>. As we select the Scripture and topic we then proceed to study the text thoroughly. Ask all of the important questions about the Scripture. Do not leave any stone unturned. Refer to the eight steps for cutting it straight.</p><p><strong>Step Four</strong>: <em>Write it Down</em>. As you read your Scripture and begin examining it you should start writing down the answers to your questions you’ve been asking. Compile your information whether in a notebook, or in a digital file. You may not use all of it, but you don’t want to lose any of it!</p><p><strong>Step Five</strong>: <em>Consulting Resources</em>. Take the time to consult with dictionaries, commentaries and word helps.</p><p><strong>Step Six</strong>: <em>Outlining</em>. &#8220;Know what you&#8217;re going to preach, just don&#8217;t preach all that you know.&#8221; Create a clear outline. If it&#8217;s not clear to you, then it will not be clear to your listeners.</p><p><strong>Study Bibles</strong></p><ul><li>ESV Study Bible</li><li>ESV Student Study Bible</li><li>Zondervan NIV Study Bible (D.A.

690	2017-05-04 20:33:20	\N	\N	\N	<p>The Bible tells us much about God and His characteristics. One can study the Bible and see many of the attributes of God explained and defined. Scripture reveals that God is a Spirit (John 4:24); that He is sovereign (Psalm 103:19); He is unchanging (Malachi 3:6); He is self-existent (Gen. 1:1; Ps. 93:2); and He is holy (Ex. 15:11). These are just a few of the attributes and qualities of God that we can know and learn from Scripture.</p><p>Though the Bible is a rich resource to help us understand God, the Bible also shrouds many of God’s attributes in mystery. Our finite minds cannot know all there is to know about an infinite God. Scripture plainly says that, “<em>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD</em>” (Isa. 55:8). Whether we like it or not, there are things about God that we will never understand until we reach our eternal reward, and even then we are not promised to know all the mysteries about God. That’s what makes Him who He is. However, what we can know about God leads us to faith in Him, and to trust Him.</p><p>When it comes to studying predestination and divine foreknowledge there is a level of mystery. What does God know? When did God know it? Are we able to change God’s mind? What role do I play in God’s plans? These are just a few of the head scratching questions that may not be easily answered. If we answer these questions incorrectly, then we do God’s character a grave injustice. Answering these questions incorrectly may also uproot one’s faith. On the other hand, if we answer these questions <em>biblically</em>, and leave tradition out, then we will glorify God and strengthen our faith. Some would rather not answer these difficult questions and leave it to mystery. But then there those, such as you dear reader, that will mine the depths of Scripture and seek God for the answers that best honor the Lord’s character and glorify who He is.</p><p><strong><u>Human Freedom and Predestination</u></strong></p><p>When one comes to certain portions of Scripture, whether it is in John’s Gospel, Romans or Ephesians then they could be led to believe there is a contradiction between human freedom and predestination. Does God’s foreknowledge intersect with human freedom?</p><p>First, God knows all things. We call this God’s <em>omniscience</em>. God is not ignorant of anything. God is never learning anything new. Unlike humans, God is not growing in knowledge or wisdom. God is all wise and all knowing. No conceivable future is unknowable to God. Since God is eternal and is present to all moments in time [past, present, and future] He already knows how humans will choose. But God’s foreknowing does not determine their choice. God can know all things, including human choices, without diminishing history’s significance or robbing humanity’s freedom.</p><p>St. Augustine wrote, “<em>Just as you do not, by your memory of them, compel past events to have happened, neither does God, by His foreknowledge, compel future events to take place.</em>” In other words, God foreknows all the things of which He is the author, but He is not Himself the Author of all that He foreknows. Origen wrote, “<em>Divine foreknowledge means not that anything will happen because God knows that it will, but that, because it will happen, God already knows it.</em>”</p><p>It is man’s will, and actions, that God foreknows. God’s divine foreknowledge does not abolish human freedom, but God knows what is in man’s heart before man acts out his will.</p><p>Theologian and church historian, Thomas Oden, wrote, “<em>The fact that God (who sees all from the beginning in eternal simultaneity) foreknew what the believer’s response would be does not imply that God is coercing the act of belief, or irresistibly determining a particular response, but rather that God is emphatically foreknowing both the options that a particular person’s freedom will experience and how one will freely choose. The Spirit’s call intends to be efficacious, but not absolutely irresistible</em>.”</p><p><strong><u>Romans 9:11-18</u></strong></p><p>The book of Romans is one of the greatest explanations of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the church in Rome, which was predominantly made up of Christian Gentiles (Rom. 1:6-7,13; 15:15-16). Claudius, the Roman Emperor, evicted the Jews (including Jewish Christians) in AD 49. However, by the time Paul wrote this letter many of the Jews and Jewish Christians had made their way back to Rome. However, the population of Jewish Christians paled in comparison to the Gentile Christians. Therefore, Paul writes with both Jews and Gentiles in mind. Paul’s treatise on sin and the depravity of human nature includes the Gentiles and Jews, making the gospel applicable to both peoples (Rom. 1:16-6:23). All are under sin, and therefore under God’s wrath (Rom. 1:18, 3:23).</p><p>The letter to the Romans can be divided into three major sections and one chapter of greetings:</p><ul><li><strong>Romans 1-8</strong>: Doctrinal</li><li><strong>Romans 9-11</strong>: Past, present, and future of Israel</li><li><strong>Romans 12-15</strong>: Practical responsibilities of Christians</li><li>(<strong>Romans 16</strong>: Personal greetings and conclusion)</li></ul><p>Without getting too technical we have to understand the context of Paul’s thoughts within this letter. If we fail to consider the context, then we will misunderstand, and misapply Paul’s thoughts concerning Israel and predestination. Romans chapter nine has always been a polarizing section of Scripture within Christianity. There are two ends to the spectrum as to what Romans nine is about.</p><p>On one end of the theological spectrum there are those who believe Romans nine is about predestination and individual salvation. On the other end of the argument are those who believe that this is solely about Israel and the choice of nations, or people. I do not want to build a straw man, or a caricature of each argument. There are many valid opinions on this portion of Scripture. While there may be two arguments at two ends of a theological spectrum, between the two sides there include many valid arguments that can help shape a bible student’s understanding.</p><p>First, Paul states his great sorrow for Israel (Rom. 9:1-5). Next, Romans 9:6a states the thesis for this portion of Romans: <strong>“</strong><em>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel</em> (ESV).” Have God’s promises to Israel failed? Has the Word of God been nullified due to Israel’s unbelief? The answer to those questions is “no.” God&#8217;s Word was not ineffective. Many Jews did believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ. To be an heir of God&#8217;s promises meant more than being born as a physical descendent of Abraham. One needed to have the same faith as Abraham and Isaac. They needed faith in Christ.</p><p>Now, within Romans 9:6-13 we are met with a few challenging propositions. Remember, Paul is still dealing with Israel and their choice of rejecting Jesus Christ as their Messiah. Has their rejection of Jesus led to the Word of God, and more importantly the promises made to Israel as God’s people, been nullified? That is the question that Paul is seeking to clarify from Romans 9:6.</p><p>God sovereignly chose Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to be the channel of blessing for the world. Abraham had other children, but it was through Isaac that the blessing and promises would come (9:7-9). Next, we read that the channel of blessing will come through Jacob, the son of Isaac, and it will not be his twin brother, Esau. Again, God’s sovereignty is on display, because He chose Jacob over Esau not because of their good works or deeds, because God’s choice was while they were still in Rebekah’s womb (9:10-13). This prophecy was not strictly concerned with Jacob and Esau individually, but it was concerning their descendants. For we do not have any record of Esau actually serving Jacob. This is about nations and peoples, and not merely about individuals. Genesis 25:23 sheds more light on the subject:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>And the Lord said to her, “Two <strong>nations</strong> are in your womb, and two <strong>peoples</strong> from within you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall <strong>serve</strong> the younger</em>.” (<strong>Gen. 25:23</strong>)</p><p><strong><u>“Esau have I hated” </u></strong></p><p>One of the most misunderstood portions of this text is Paul briefly quoting the Old Testament passage: “<em>I have loved you,” says the Lord. But you say, ‘How have you loved us?’ ‘Is not Esau Jacob’s brother?’ declares the Lord. ‘Yet I have loved Jacob but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert”</em> (Mal. 1:2-3).</p><p>This Old Testament reference is dealing with Edom (Esau’s descendants). Malachi 1:2-3 is not about individual salvation. It is displaying God’s choice of choosing Jacob over Esau, and Edom (Esau’s descendants) who mistreated Israel during the Babylonian invasion. Of course, there are many other instances of Edom mistreating Israel in the Old Testament.</p><p>Did God hate Esau? Remember, God chose Jacob over Esau before they were born. New Testament scholar, William Greathouse, wrote, “<em>Loving and hating in this context are Semitic ways of expressing a preference for one party and a rejection of another (Deut. 21:15). Importantly, nothing is said about the ultimate fate of either Esau or his Edomite descendants</em>.” It should be noted that the Edomites could be saved too if they would have faith in Jesus.</p><p>The word <strong>&#8220;hated&#8221;</strong> does not mean, &#8220;to dislike or abhor.&#8221; It is a Hebrew phrase or idiom. When a Hebrew compares a less love with a greater love, the less love is referred to as <em>hated,</em> even though the person is not hated. Leah is an example of this truth too:</p><p><em>And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren </em>(Gen. 29:31).</p><p>Jacob didn’t hate Leah. He just didn&#8217;t love her as much as Rachel. Just the same, God did not hate or abhor Esau, instead He chose Jacob to be part of the channel of blessing.</p><p>New Testament scholar, Douglas Moo, comments, “<em>What seems clear is that none of these texts says anything directly about the spiritual fate of the individuals Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, and Esau. The Old Testament does not—at least in these texts—reflect on whether they were saved or not; it is concerned solely with the roles they would play in salvation history. God’s election of them is not election to salvation but election to play a certain role in the unfolding plan of God. If Paul is using these texts in accordance with their original intent, he, too, must be reflecting on the way God has chosen certain people, or nations, to play positive and negative roles in salvation history. Isaac, Jacob, and Israel contributed to God’s plan by carrying on his promise. Ishmael, Esau, and Edom contributed also to that plan by opposing God and his people and giving God the opportunity to display his glory</em>.”</p><p>Scripture declares that God is sovereign (Job 9:12; Ps. 29:10). God’s decisions and choices are based on God’s holiness and perfect justice. What may seem unfair, or illogical, are in fact just because God is sovereign. Remember, God’s ways are not our ways and neither are His thoughts like our thoughts (Isa. 55:8).</p><p>With that said, let’s look at Romans 9:11-18. Bible commentator, J Sidlow Baxter, writes, “<em>This passage is about God&#8217;s dealings with men and nations historically and is not about individual salvation and men&#8217;s destinies beyond the grave</em>.”</p><p>Romans nine is a summary of Israel’s history as God’s chosen people and has little to do with salvation, eternal life or death of individuals. God chose the descendants of Isaac and Jacob to be the channel of blessing and service to mankind. Jacob was chosen over Esau before birth, not because of any deeds or works (9:11-12). God chose Jacob&#8217;s family tree to be the channel of blessing to the world. The Gospel came to the Jew first. Because the Jews have rejected the Gospel and Christ, God has chosen to use the Church, with both a remnant of believing Jews and Gentiles, as the channel of blessing to the world. Is God done with Israel? No! The Church, with the revelation that Jesus Christ is Messiah, has now been elected to be the channel of blessing to the world.</p><p>God does not choose people to be saved and others to be lost. If someone goes to hell it is on the basis of his or her rejection of Jesus Christ, and his or her refusal to do God’s will. What is God’s will? “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; <strong><em>but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance</em></strong>” (2 Peter 3:9).</p><p>Scripture repeats over and over again that God does not desire that any perish, but that all would come to repentance:</p><ul><li><strong>John 3:16</strong> For God so loved <strong><em>the world</em></strong>, that he gave his only begotten Son, that <strong><em>whosoever</em></strong> believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</li><li><strong>1 Timothy 2:4 </strong>Who will have <strong><em>all</em></strong> men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</li><li><strong>1 Timothy 2:6 </strong>Who gave himself a ransom for <strong><em>all</em></strong>, to be testified in due time.</li><li><strong>Titus 2:11 </strong>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to <strong><em>all men.</em></strong></li><li><strong>2 Corinthians 5:15 </strong>And <em>that</em> he died for <strong><em>all</em></strong>, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</li></ul><p>God elected a plan of salvation, which He accomplished in Jesus Christ. Humanity can accept or reject His plan. God also elected a people to make known His elected plan of salvation, the Church. He chose Israel first and now the Church. Man has the will and the choice to believe or reject. The renowned American evangelist, DL Moody, wrote, “<em>The elect are the whosoever wills and the non-elect are the whosoever won&#8217;t.&#8221;</em></p><p><strong>Pharaoh’s Hard Heart</strong></p><p>The next question has to do with Paul’s reference to Pharaoh’s hard heart. What does it mean that God hardened Pharaoh’s heart? Bible commentator Rod Mattoon wrote, “<em>According to Romans 9:17-18, God preserved Pharaoh in the plagues and used Pharaoh to demonstrate His power and glory. God knew Pharaoh was stubborn. He knew what Pharaoh would choose to do. He did not cause Pharaoh to sin. God arranged events knowing how Pharaoh would respond</em>.”</p><p>Paul shifts from the Patriarchs of Israel to Moses and the exodus. The nation of Israel was under the bondage of Egyptian slavery. Pharaoh refused to let Israel go, despite Moses’ warnings. Pharaoh refused to let God’s people go, and refused to do God’s will. The word “harden” in the Greek refers to being in a state of insensitivity to God, his Word, and his work. Pharaoh was making his own decisions and his heart was being hardened as a consequence. Mattoon continues, “<em>If Pharaoh was totally depraved, why would the Lord later on have to harden his heart as a judgment upon Pharaoh? Pharaoh was not created to be &#8220;hardened.&#8221; Pharaoh hardened his own heart after each of the first five plagues. Each time he could have chosen to obey the Lord. He disobeyed and refused to give in to the Lord and got harder and harder. After the sixth plague, God hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart as a judgment upon him. After the seventh plague, Pharaoh was given a choice to repent. Pharaoh hardened his heart</em>.”</p><p>Pharaoh could have obeyed God and let Israel go, instead his heart was hardened. If we continue to act in rebellion as Pharaoh did then our hearts too will be hardened.</p><p>The doctrine of predestination and foreknowledge are sensitive topics that must be taken with upmost seriousness. However, we must allow Scripture to guide our understanding instead of letting Christian developments and ideas hundreds of years removed from Scripture’s original writing influence our interpretation. We can glean and learn from others, but we must allow Scripture to speak on its own terms, and always allow context to be the most important factor.</p>	100	\N	The Attributes of God: Divine Foreknowledge and Predestination	\N

696	2017-03-13 12:56:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>The following was written by Bishop Billy McCool in 2010.</p><p><strong>What’s Wrong with Holiness?</strong></p><p>Holiness is not a privation it is a privilege, it is not a burden it is a blessing, it is not an obligation but an opportunity, it is not a loss but a liberty. Holiness is not hard, but a harbor. It is my protection against promiscuity, the loss of my reputation and the loss of my sensitivity.  It is my shield against sin.</p><p>Holiness does not require me to puncture my body thousands of times with needles risking infection in order to get a tattoo. Holiness does not require me to painfully pierce my body, my ears, my nose, nor my eyebrows. Holiness does not require me to wear a metal pin poked through my tongue.  Holiness does not require me to pierce my navel in order to wear body jewelry.  Holiness does not require me to shave my head, bleach my hair or color it in outlandish colors. Holiness does not require me to paint my face or disfigure myself in any way.  Holiness has no abusive initiation in order to be a member.</p><p>Holiness requires the least change and the least effort from a normal and natural life style than any fraternity, sorority, club, lodge or labor union.  It is not expensive to be Holiness. It requires no uniforms, demands no degrees, and requires no pedigree. No one can prevent me from being Holiness regardless of their status or political power.  Holiness is not affected by the car I drive, the house or neighborhood in which I live.

697	2017-03-09 14:11:51	\N	\N	\N	<p>AW Tozer said, “What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.”</p><p>It has been said that a high view of God leads to a high and holy lifestyle. On the other hand a low view of God leads to low living. Right thinking about God leads to right living. Much of what ails the modern church is faulty thinking about God. For there to be a reformation within the church there must first be a reformation of how we view God.</p><p>To begin to change our thoughts about God, and our wonder of Him, then we must think rightly of who He is. When you want to get to know someone you want to learn about his or her characteristics. Your relationship deepens and matures, as you know more about each other. For our relationship with God to deepen we must attempt to know Him. Fortunately, God has revealed Himself through the Scriptures. God has shared attributes and characteristics about Himself that we might grow in our knowledge of Him.</p><p>Attributes are the qualities that belong to a person. It’s what we attribute to one’s person. Attributes are the characteristics of a person. By studying the attributes of God we get a better understanding of who He is. Such a study inevitably draws us closer to God. Job wrote, “Acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace: Thereby God shall come unto thee” (Job 22:21). We are to acquaint ourselves with the Living God.</p><p>The heavens declare the glory of God, and God has revealed Himself by general revelation through creation (Psa. 19:1; Rom. 1:19-20). But it is Scripture that gives us the ability to study God and who He is.</p><p>Now, we are not taking God into a laboratory to put Him under a microscope. And it should be noted that this type of study is quite the dichotomy. Can the finite study the infinite? Can we comprehend the incomprehensible? God is not like anything, or anyone. God is infinite, and His thoughts and ways are higher than ours (Isa. 55:8-9). Humanity does not have the words or language to perfectly describe what God is like. We can say honestly, “Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders” (Ex. 15:11)? The writers of Scripture had to use language, images, figures of speech, and metaphors in attempt to describe God. Making an attempt to study God may seem futile. However, God beckons us to draw close to Him, and He will draw close to us (James 4:8).</p><p>Christians need more than a theoretical knowledge of God. We need to know God within the depths of our hearts and souls. By learning more about God, and understanding who God is, Christians become better equipped to learn about themselves. By doing so they have a clearer, and more biblical worldview. To have a greater understanding of God is profitable for Christian living. It goes back to Tozer’s statement that a high view of God leads to high living. If we are wrong about who God is then we will be wrong about everything else. If we are to live godly then we must know what God is like.</p><p>A study of God’s attributes and person should provoke us to worship. How can we worship that which we do not know? Weak worship in the church is a direct result of not knowing much about God. A greater knowledge about God will lead to greater worship of God. The church doesn’t need better music or better songs. The church needs a greater depth of knowing God.</p><p>It is my intent to write a series of posts concerning the attributes of God. Together we will study the attributes of God that are not shared with humanity, namely God’s omniscience, immutability, power, omnipresence and so forth. And we will study the attributes of God that He empowers us to share with Him namely love, wisdom, goodness, and holiness.</p><p>It is my prayer and hope that we can grow in our knowledge, worship and love of God.</p>	100	\N	The Attributes of God	\N	/img_1662.jpg
698	2017-03-04 21:37:54	\N	\N	\N	<h3>I. Introduction</h3><p>Oxford Dictionaries has decided that the word of the year in 2016 was <em>post-truth</em>. According to journalist Amy Wang (2016) Oxford Dictionary defines <em>post-truth</em> as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” Truth is now subjective. Fact is the handmaiden to feeling. Truth is subservient to emotions. Doubt is in the driver’s seat while truth takes a backseat.</p><p>Such an intolerance of truth leaves the Christian standing on an island holding the Bible with the belief that Scripture claims its complete truthfulness (Jn. 17:17). Can Christians place their confidence in Scripture’s authority while such an intolerance of truth is propagated? From Paul’s letter to Timothy one can see that Paul was persuaded by Scripture’s truthfulness and admonished Timothy to continue to believe in this foundational truth of both Judaism and Christianity (2 Tim. 3:15-17).</p><p>The beginning of the third chapter of 2 Timothy is Paul’s warning of difficult times coming in the last days (2 Tim. 3:1). Wickedness, evil and false teachers will increase (3:2-9). The bookend of this section is concluded with the statement that people will not endure sound doctrine and will turn from the truth (4:3-4). Looking at the context of 2 Timothy 3:16-17 one can see that people will forsake truth and in turn wickedness will increase. However, Paul exhorts Timothy to continue in the sacred scriptures that he has been taught since his childhood (2 Tim. 3:14-15). Next, Paul reminds Timothy of Scripture’s character, function, and objective (2 Tim. 3:16-17).</p><p>Christians can place their confidence in Scripture&#8217;s authority by reason of Scripture&#8217;s divine origin.</p><ol><li><strong> The Character of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:14-16)</strong></li><li><strong> Sacred Writings (2 Tim. 3:15)</strong></li></ol><p>Amidst an increase in evil, false teaching, and persecution for living a godly life, Timothy is to stand firm on what he has been taught, namely the sacred writings (3:15). Bible commentator Donald Guthrie remarks, “He is to continue in the sense of ‘abiding’ in the things he has learned and been assured of” (Guthrie, 1979, p. 162). The word “<em>continue</em>” in the Greek is in the present tense and suggests that Timothy had been living what he had been taught from perhaps his mother and grandmother since he was child (1:5; 3:15). Timothy was to continue not only in what he had been taught, but what he had believed. Truth was not solely to be taught, it was to be believed.</p><p>The source of Timothy’s assurance is the “sacred writings.” The NIV translates the Greek form <em>heira grammata </em>as “holy Scriptures.” Bible commentator Walter Liefeld comments, “The holy Scriptures refer to what we know as the Old Testament and what the Jewish people call the Tanach” (Liefeld, 1999, p. 278). The phrase <em>heira grammata </em>is rather peculiar in light of verse sixteen. Ben Witherington wrote, “This is of course a reference to the Old Testament for there was no New Testament as of yet. As a Jew with a Jewish mother, Timothy apparently had been instructed in the Torah, perhaps particularly the Pentateuch, which may be one reason why Paul chose the example from the life of Moses earlier in this chapter” (Witherington, 2006, p. 359). The sacred writings were to be the foundation for Timothy’s faith, due to the fact that they were able to make one wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ (3:15b).</p><h4><strong>Inspired Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16)</strong></h4><p>Paul continues his thought on the “sacred writings” that all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness (3:16). Again the reader is presented with the question as to why Paul used two different Greek terms to describe Scripture. In verse 15 Paul uses <em>heira grammata </em>and now uses “<em>graphe.</em>” According to Kevin Smith (2010) the Greek word graphe occurs 50 times in the Greek New Testament (p. 95). Concerning <em>graphe </em>Smith continues, “Although in extra biblical Greek it could refer simply to a piece of writing, in the New Testament it is a technical term for ‘sacred scripture” (Smith, 2010, p. 95). The issue remains about whether Paul is including portions of the New Testament that had been completed at that time. Smith answers this question succinctly: “Forty-seven of the 50 occurrences of <em>graphe </em>refer unambiguously and exclusively to the Old Testament. Two, however, hint that the teachings of Christ and the writings of Paul were already considered as ‘scripture’ in the early decades of the church” (Smith, 2010, p. 95).</p><p>At this juncture of the New Testament church, and before the New Testament canon had been completed, certain of Jesus’ sayings had been considered Scripture (1 Cor. 7:10). Paul also expected his own letters to be read publicly as authoritative (Col. 4:16). The Apostle Peter also invariably suggested that Paul’s letters as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16). It should also be noted within this context Paul included his own teaching as something Timothy had followed (2 Tim. 3:10).</p><h4><strong>Divine Origin (2 Tim. 3:16a)</strong></h4><p>Paul was not hesitant to claim Scripture’s divine origin for he wrote to Timothy, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16). Another issue within the text of 2 Timothy 3:15-17 is the phrase “breathed out by God.” Breathed out by God has also been translated as “inspired by God” (NASB); “is given by inspiration of God” (KJV); “All Scripture is God-breathed” (NIV). The Greek word used to describe this divine authorship is <em>theopneustos, </em>which is a compound Greek word<em>,</em> comprised of <em>theos</em> (God); <em>pneo</em> (breathe); and <em>pneuma</em> (Spirit). There is some suggestive use of the creation account where God created by simply speaking (Gen. 1:3-31). Considering that Timothy had been brought up being taught the Old Testament, especially the Torah, he would understand Paul’s usage of inspiration (2 Tim. 3:14-15).</p><p>But how does this inspiration process work? How does God “inspire” biblical writers? Witherington gives his opinion: “These questions are not answered here. What is suggested is that whatever the process, the product is God’s Word, telling God’s truth” (Witherington, 2006, p. 360). J.I. Packer comments, “The thought is not of God as breathing through Scripture, or of Scripture as breathing out God, but of God as having breathed out Scripture” (Packer, 1996, p. 227). Scripture is a divine product of God. It should it be noted that Paul emphatically says that<em> all</em> Scripture is breathed out by God, leaving little room for doubt in the truthfulness of any portion of Scripture.</p><h3><strong>II. The Functions of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16b-17)</strong></h3><p>The function of Scripture is that it is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16). Smith comments on the second part of this text, “Paul’s own emphasis, however, is on the rest of the passage. The inspiration of Scripture was not disputed. Paul’s aim was not to assert the inspiration of the Scriptures, but to elucidate the value of the inspired scriptures” (Smith, 2010, p. 100). Timothy was to continue in what he had believed, which was a contrast to those who had swerved from truth and from listening to truth (2:18; 4:4). This was due to that fact that inspired Scripture was profitable, despite what others thought. Therefore, Scripture has at least four functions: teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness. Scripture’s divine origin produces its useful functions in the life of the Christian. Paul alluded to Scripture’s usefulness in Romans 15:4, “For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Teaching</strong></h4><p>The King James Version translates <em>didaskalian</em> as “doctrine.” Ackerman writes, “This refers to instruction in doctrine and conduct. In the Pastoral Epistles, the focus of true teaching is the gospel” (Ackerman, 2016, p. 360). Mounce (2000) adds that <em>didaskalian </em>is a technical term for the doctrinal formulation of Scripture (p. 570). Paul’s first point of emphasis in the function of Scripture is its value for teaching. Looking at the context of 1 and 2 Timothy one can see that the church in Ephesus was continually battling false teachers and false teaching (1 Tim. 1: 3-4, 19; 4:1-4, 7; 5:19-20; 6:4-5, 20-21; 2 Tim. 2:16-18, 23; 3:1-7; 4:4). Scripture is to be used as the combatant for false doctrine. If Timothy was going to lead the churches he had to do so by teaching Scripture, and doing so with precision (2 Tim. 2:15).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Reproof and Correction</strong></h4><p>Paul moves from Scripture’s usefulness for doctrine to its usefulness for conduct. This is the only appearance of <em>elegmon</em>, which is the Greek word for reproof. This involves the idea of correcting errant behaviors or ideas. What Scripture reproves can inevitably be corrected by it. Leifeld comments, “The first use of Scripture Paul lists is doctrinal. Its use for ‘rebuking’ and ‘correcting’ may not seem primary to the modern reader. However, given the major function of the Pastoral Letters to address the problem of false teaching in Ephesus and Crete, these functions have obvious significance” (Liefeld, 1999, p. 280). That significance is that biblical doctrine not only rebukes false teaching, but also corrects it. In other words, Scripture can straighten out what false teaching has perverted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Training in Righteousness</strong></h4><p>Paul uses the word “training.” The Greek word for training is <em>paideia</em>. Sound biblical teaching may include the discipline. Paul uses this same word (<em>paideia</em>) in Ephesians 6:4 in reference to fathers to train or instruct their children in the fear of the Lord. Mounce comments, “Positively, Scripture is useful to train in righteousness since it provides not only the content of belief but also the guidelines for conduct” (Mounce, 2000, p. 570). Training in righteous insinuates that Timothy should use Scripture to teach believers how to live righteously. Scripture was not only to be used to correct false doctrine, but also to correct erroneous behavior. In essence orthodoxy should lead to orthopraxy. Smith writes, “Thus the scriptures are useful for correcting both doctrinal and behavioral error. Training in righteousness denotes guiding believers regarding how to live righteously” (Smith, 2010, p. 101).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>III. The Objective of Scripture (2 Timothy 3:17)</strong></h3><p>Paul concludes his thought by reminding Timothy of scripture’s objective: “That the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:17). The objective of Scripture follows the four functions of teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness. Bible commentator Phillip Towner wrote, “Ultimately, Paul’s argument about Scripture’s inspiration and usefulness is not an academic matter but a very practical one. In v. 17 he adds a statement that describes the chief purpose toward which his logic has been pressing all along – ‘that the person of God’ might be capable, fully equipped for every good deed’” (Towner, 2006, p. 592).</p><p>The Greek word for “man” is <em>anthropos </em>which has been translated as “person” in many other bible translations. Mounce comments on Paul’s use of <em>anthropos</em>: The phrase is directed specifically to Timothy, a ‘man of god’ (1 Tim. 6:11), and to all Christian leaders, but by implication to all Christians (hence, ‘person’)” (Mounce, 2000, p. 571). Therefore, Paul’s list of Scripture’s function was not exclusive to ministers, but to all Christians who seek to live righteously.</p><p>The person of God will be complete and equipped for every good work by studying Scripture. Ackerman wrote, “The goal is that believers become <em>artios</em>. This rare NT word has the basic meaning of ‘being well fitted for some function, complete, capable, proficient” (Ackerman, 2016, p. 361). In essence it describes what is proper of becoming a Christian.</p><p>However, Scripture not only will complete (<em>artios</em>) believers they will also be thoroughly equipped (<em>exertismenos</em>) for every good work. Ackerman comments, “The <em>ek</em> prefix at the beginning adds emphasis and shows that something has been completely prepared for service” (Ackerman, 2010, p. 361). The “good works” refers to exceptional behavior towards a person’s God-given calling and how they treat others (1 Tim. 2:10; 5:10, 25; 6:18; 2 Tim. 2:21).</p><p>Smith comments, “The point of 1 Timothy 3:16-17 is that the Scriptures equip the man of God to do what God wants in all circumstances; they equip him by instructing him as to what God expects” (Smith, 2010, p. 103). Therefore, Scripture can correct erroneous teaching and behavior due to its divine origin. If God is the author of Scripture, then one can come to the conclusion that Scripture can lead one to be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work that comes from God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>IV. Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Just as Timothy could place his utmost confidence in Scripture’s truthfulness, Christians can place their confidence in Scripture&#8217;s authority by reason of Scripture&#8217;s divine origin. Second Timothy 3:16-17 affirms that “all Scripture is God-breathed.” Within the context Paul gives examples of what Scripture can accomplish for the Christian. First, it makes one “wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.” Scripture has the power to bring one to faith in Jesus Christ, and to bring one to the knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25; James 1:18; 1 Pet. 1:23). False teaching and erroneous doctrine never leads to a knowledge of the truth, and only leads to ungodly living (2 Tim. 2:16; 3:7-8). Second, Scripture is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training in righteousness. This encompasses how Scripture works in the life of the Christian. Christians are not to wander off into myths, and vain babbling. They are to be complete, and equipped for every good work. Christians can be complete and thoroughly equipped because Scripture has been given by God. Liefeld concludes, “The affirmation of inspiration at the center must not be isolated from this context of purpose. At the same time, one’s belief about the meaning of inspiration must not be camouflaged by exclusive emphasis on those purposes” (Liefeld, 1999, p. 284). Therefore, Christians can place their entire trust in Scripture for developing a worldview, and living it out, because God is the Author of all Scripture.</p><p>[<em>This essay was written as the final research paper and capstone&nbsp; for my bachelor&#8217;s degree in Biblical Studies from Indiana Wesleyan</em>]</p><h4>References</h4><p>Smith, Kevin G.

699	2016-12-13 14:44:53	\N	\N	\N	<p>The New Year presents a clean slate in which we can write the narrative of an improved spiritual life. Resolutions and goals are the stuff Januarys are made of. At the beginning of each year we set lofty goals to improve our spiritual well being. Like our physical health, we intend to shed a few unwanted carnal pounds that may have hindered our spiritual progress last year. So we set sail into the new adventure of trying to attain such lofty spiritual resolutions.</p><p>Face it you just can’t help yourself. You tell yourself that are going to read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Next, you write down that you will pray more. And since you didn’t fast nearly enough last year you will set the goal of increasing your fasting. “This will be the year,” you tell yourself. Then February and March come traipsing into your life intruding on all of your well-intentioned resolutions and goals. The months following January are the unwanted houseguests that never seem to leave. What once looked so hopeful is now an afterthought. All of the energy and enthusiasm have since moved out and real life and his ruthless friends have moved in.</p><p>A U.S. Government survey shows a little less than half of all Americans make some kind of New Year&#8217;s resolution, but most don&#8217;t keep them. 75% will last a week, 64% will keep them for a month and only 46% will ever make it to the six-month mark. Those are not inspiring percentages.</p><p>What will keep you focused on your spiritual resolutions beyond the first month? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Art-Spiritual-Disciplines-ebook/dp/B00C9GENFQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1481640203&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=the+lost+art+of+spiritual+disciplines">discipline</a>. Enthusiasm is fickle and inspiration is fleeting. Inspiration and enthusiasm wear off faster than your morning cup of coffee. What you and I need is discipline. But discipline in and of itself is not enough. A nineteen-year-old pastor by the name of Jonathan Edwards penned in his diary some guidelines, which he came to call his “Resolutions.” These seventy resolutions were quite towering in their scope of discipline. Before Edwards got to number one, however, he offered an introductory word:</p><p>“Being sensible that I am unable to do anything without God’s help, I do humbly entreat him by his grace to enable me to keep these resolutions, so far as they are agreeable to his will for Christ’s sake.”</p><p>Discipline without the grace of God is futile. Do not overlook the necessity of God’s grace in reaching your spiritual resolutions for the upcoming New Year. Without God’s grace enabling us to keep our resolutions we are certain to fail. But if we do fail, and we will, then we can rest in the grace of God to pick us back up to start over again.</p><h3><strong><u>Be Realistic</u></strong></h3><p>Nothing can be more detrimental to achieving your spiritual resolutions than setting goals so high that even Goliath couldn’t reach them. But you also don’t want to set your goals so low that Zacchaeus could high jump over it. Be realistic with yourself. If you have never read your Bible through from beginning to end then don’t try reading it five times in the year. Get a Bible reading plan and read the given chapters, and if you are feeling audacious, you could read ahead.</p><p>If you want to increase your praying then begin by increasing your time little by little. There’s no sense in trying to pray for an hour if you have never done that. Try increasing your prayer time by 5-10 minutes. After you have done that for a few weeks or months increase it a little bit more.</p><h3><strong><u>Be Resolved</u></strong></h3><p>Resolve is being completely committed to achieving a goal. Being resolved is a discipline in itself. A prized fighter has to continually train to become a champion. He takes the punches and keeps getting back up. You have to have the mindset that your spiritual resolutions are worth fighting for. Praying more is invaluable. Studying the Bible is priceless. Fasting is worth the struggle. So you keep getting back up when you miss your prayer time. You put the gloves back on when you forget to read your Bible. This is resolve.</p><p>Paul writes to Timothy, “discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness” (1 Timothy 4:7 ESV). We are to discipline ourselves for the purpose of godliness. Godliness is worth the struggle of attaining my spiritual resolutions. Granted it will be difficult after the high of enthusiasm has faded. But you must be resolved that your spiritual health is of far greater value than bodily exercise (1 Tim. 4:8).</p><p>In order for a life to be altered for greater godliness, there has to be a plan of action. Discipline takes time. Bursts of great enthusiasm may create a level of excitement, and for a short time there may be some results. A spiritually disciplined lifestyle has to be sustained. The old saying goes that practice makes perfect, and that holds true for spiritual disciplines. The more consistently they are followed the more they will perfect us in godliness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>	100	\N	The Discipline of Resolve	\N	/img_1660.jpg

701	2016-11-05 17:20:37	\N	\N	\N	<p>Epic. Revolutionary. World Changing. Extreme. Radical. Incredible. Emergent. Amazing. Cutting Edge. Supernatural. Next Level. Otherworldly.</p><p>Such words are common in sermons, speeches and motivational seminars and are used to inspire and excite listeners in hopes of seeing people lead extraordinary lives.</p><p><strong>Ordinary has to be one of the loneliest and boring words in our English vocabulary</strong>. Who wants to have a bumper sticker on their car, or on their laptop that says, “ordinary”? A parent doesn’t put “<strong>my child is an ordinary student at Around The Corner Elementary</strong>.” Who wants to live in an ordinary town, work at an ordinary job, and have ordinary friends? And definitely no one wants to attend an ordinary church. If we are going to leave a legacy and an enduring impact upon history then our lives can be anything but ordinary.</p><p><strong>Our generation is terrified of boredom</strong>. <strong>What they fear is missing out on the next big thing.</strong></p><p>George Barna records the following: “Six in 10 young people will leave the church permanently or for an extended period starting at age 15, according to new research by the Barna Group. And for the generation now coming of age, it&#8217;s more than the usual ‘driver&#8217;s license to marriage license’ joy ride, according to the pollsters. For church leaders, the question is, what will we do about it?”</p><p>In another survey George Barna writes, “The research project was comprised of eight national studies, including interviews with teenagers, young adults, parents, youth pastors, and senior pastors. The study of young adults focused on those who were regular churchgoers Christian church during their teen years and explored their reasons for disconnection from church life after age 15. <strong>31% of those polled said church was ‘boring.’” </strong></p><p>Many grow disenfranchised with church and Christianity because they do not know what real Christianity looks like. <strong>We encourage youth and the adult alike to turn their worlds upside down, yet they don’t see why it is necessary to change a world that they love.</strong></p><p>What does the real church look like? What does real-life Christianity look like? What does authenticity in the first church look like?</p><p><strong>The answer to changing the world is being steadfast in the ordinary. The future of the church is in the ancient.</strong></p><p><strong><u>After Pentecost</u></strong></p><p>That first church was an ordinary church. Jesus had ascended, and sent the Holy Spirit. The gospel was preached by Peter in which Jesus was declared as Lord and Messiah, and 3,000 people believed, were baptized, and the church was born.</p><p>What was that first church like?&nbsp; They were involved in what we would consider to be ordinary actions, or ordinary realities.&nbsp; Verse 42, “And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.”<strong> These are the ordinary tasks that every church should be engaged in.&nbsp; </strong>This is the life of the church.&nbsp; There’s nothing in there about entertainment.&nbsp; Nothing that is spectacular.&nbsp; There isn’t anything mentioned that catapults someone to some other spiritual level.</p><p>This is not just a summary of what happened on one day, but it is a summary of what happened daily.</p><p><strong><u>Steadfast</u></strong></p><p>Luke begins to describe the early church by telling us that the believers in it were distinguished by their <strong><em>devotion to the apostles’ teaching, to fellowship with one another, to “breaking of bread,” and “to prayer</em></strong>.” The verb translated “devoted” or “steadfast” (<strong><em>proskartereō</em></strong>) is a common one that connotes a steadfast and single-minded fidelity to a certain course of action. Luke uses it elsewhere in Acts to characterize the devotion of the 120 in the upper room to prayer (1:14) and the apostles’ resolve in the matter of the Hellenistic widows to center their attention on prayer and the ministry of the word (6:4)</p><p>The first church was committed, persistent, faithful and steadfast. What were they committed to?</p><ol><li>Doctrine</li><li>To each other</li><li>Prayer</li><li>Giving</li><li>Attending the temple</li></ol><p><strong><u>Steadfast in Doctrine</u></strong></p><p>An ordinary church is a church committed to the Word of God.&nbsp; Verse 42 says, “They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching.”&nbsp; Devoted and committed to the apostles’ doctrine.&nbsp; That is simply a reference to the fact that the apostles were the bearers of divine revelation, which was authenticated by the miracles, which they did, which then validated them as the spokesmen for God.&nbsp; And it was their teaching, the teaching of the apostles that was the substance of the study of the early church.&nbsp; This is important.&nbsp; An ordinary church is a church that is completely involved in the study of biblical truth.&nbsp; It was the apostles and their associates who eventually wrote down their doctrine and it composed the New Testament, the New Testament.</p><p>The word “<strong>doctrine</strong>” or “<strong>teaching</strong>” in the Greek is <strong><em>didache</em></strong>, which means instruction or lessons. The apostle’s doctrine included, but was not limited to, all of the Old Testament Scriptures and their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ’s life, death and resurrection.</p><p>After Pentecost there had to be instruction, there had to be teaching. We love Pentecost and all that relates to it. <strong>However, every day cannot be Pentecost.</strong> What keeps you is doctrine. <strong>Doctrine informs, forms and transforms disciples</strong>. Doctrine directs the church by urging Christians to do what they know.</p><p>Desire for God without doctrine is blind; doctrine without desire is empty.</p><p>To be a follower of Christ is to be a follower of Scripture. The words “teaching”, “teach”, “taught” “doctrine”, “preach”, “preaching” are used 37 times in Acts. That’s not including “heard the word” “Word of God” “word of the Lord” that is used in reference to preaching and teaching.</p><p>The power of the new and exciting, the power of campaigns, movements and strategies cannot forgive sins or raise the dead. It is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which has the power of God for salvation (Rom. 1:16)</p><p><strong><em>The ordinary church is steadfast in doctrine</em></strong>. They renew and transform their minds by the Word of God. <strong><em>The ordinary church is a fellowshipping church</em></strong>. The people of God don’t come to watch and be entertained; they come to be with each other, not forsaking the assembling of each other. <strong><em>The ordinary church is a praying church</em></strong>. They have promises to claim and miracles to experience. The ordinary church is faithful to the house of God. Jesus Christ and the church are the center of their lives. <strong><em>The ordinary church is a giving church</em></strong>. They are willing to sacrifice to see the kingdom of God advance. <strong><em>The ordinary church is a worshiping church</em></strong>. Their love is for Jesus Christ and to see Him high and lifted up. But in the end, <strong><em>this ordinary church experienced extraordinary blessing</em></strong>.</p><p>Verse 47 ends with this.&nbsp; “And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.” The Lord builds the church.&nbsp;He adds to it.&nbsp; He doesn’t ask us to be radical, extreme, over-the-top, transformative, emergent, or any other adjective.&nbsp; He asks us to remain steadfast and committed and faithful to the Word of God and the Spirit of God, and He will take care of the extraordinary part.</p><p><strong>References and Bibliography</strong></p><p>J.

702	2016-10-05 11:09:34	\N	\N	\N	<p>In our <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2016/10/04/justification-and-righteousness-in-romans-and-galatians-pt-1/">previous study</a> we looked at God&#8217;s righteousness, humanity&#8217;s sinfulness and our need for salvation. In this lesson we will look briefly at Paul&#8217;s cure for the curse of sin.</p><p><strong>I. The Savior: Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:12-6:14)</strong></p><p>Humanity is in need of salvation from sin, death and God’s wrath. Nothing within humanity has the ability to save (Rom. 7:18). It is only through the obedience of Jesus Christ in his life, death and resurrection that humanity can experience justification. The question is then: how is God’s righteousness imputed into sinful humanity? Is it by works of the Law? Not according to Paul.</p><p>The first Adam brought sin and death into the world; the Second Adam brought salvation and new life into the world (Rom. 5:12-21). Piper notes, “So Adam’s transgression is contrasted with Christ’s righteousness, which is understood as a gift. The implication is that although Adam’s transgression brought death to many, Christ’s righteousness, as a free gift abounded for many” (Piper, 2002, p. 104).</p><p><strong>II. The Solution: Justification by Faith (Rom. 3:21-4:25, 6:1-23; Gal. 3:1-29)</strong></p><p>Paul argues that justification and righteousness are obtained by faith, “What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith” (Rom. 9:30). Righteousness is not obtained by works of the Law, or by circumcision. “Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law” (Gal. 3:21). Paul uses Abraham in Romans 4 and Galatians 3 as an illustration to show that Abraham was considered righteous before he was circumcised (Rom. 4:2-3; Gal. 3:7-18). However, faith is not considered a work of humanity. God derives faith. Greathouse rightly adds, “Paul refuses to consider faith a human work of any kind (vv. 4-5). Quite the contrary, faith trusts in God’s word and work so completely that it despairs of human work as a means of gaining God’s favor” (Greathouse, 2008, p. 138).</p><p>According to Packer, “Justification means to Paul God’s act of remitting the sins of guilty men, and accounting them righteous, freely, by his grace, through faith in Christ, on the ground, not of their own works, but of the representative law-keeping and redemptive blood-shedding of the Lord Jesus Christ on their behalf” (Packer, 1996, p. 684).</p><p><strong>a. Faith Not Works (3:21-4:25)</strong></p><p>Paul’s polemic against justification by works is that righteousness can only be obtained through faith in Jesus Christ. The works of the Law cannot bring life considering that they only brought condemnation (Rom. 7:7-12; Gal. 3:10-12). Wright states, “Works of the law cannot justify, because God has redefined his people through the faithfulness of the Messiah” (Wright, 2009, p. 97). The Law only reveals sin it cannot forgive sin. No one can rely on the works of the Law to produce justification, because the righteous will live by faith (Gal. 3:11). Paul argues that the Law is not based upon faith, and it cannot produce righteousness but it can only produce judgment and curse (Gal. 3:10-14).</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Whether you are a Jew or a Gentile you are a sinner in need of redemption (Rom. 3:9-18; 23). Being ignorant of God’s righteous demands is inexcusable (Rom. 1:18-32). Attempting to keep the Mosaic Law is inefficient (Rom. 2:1-29). The only way for one to be saved is through Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:21-26; 5:1-21). One can be justified by faith and have the righteousness of Christ imputed to them only by faith.</p><p>(<em>This was written as a final research paper for Indiana Wesleyan University</em>)</p><p>You can read more of my position on salvation in the New Testament <a href="http://nswhitley.com/index.php/2016/09/25/theology-of-salvation-in-john-acts-and-pauls-epistles/">here</a>.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Greathouse, W.M., &amp; Lyons, G.

703	2016-10-04 11:13:23	\N	\N	\N	<p>There is nothing quite like getting a gift, especially a gift that you do not deserve. This is how the Apostle Paul describes being saved from sin and death by Jesus Christ. Sinful humanity has been given a gift, the gift of salvation and they only have to believe to receive it (Rom. 5:13-21).</p><p>In the letters to the Romans and the Galatians Paul makes his case for justification by faith and not by works of the Law. For the Roman Christians Paul emphatically shows that all of humanity is guilty of sin and deserving of God’s wrath (Rom. 1:18; 3:23 NIV). For the Galatians Paul unpacks the implications of attempting to be justified by circumcision and the Law, and also teaches that one can only be counted righteous by faith (Gal. 3:1-22). While the contexts of each letter may differ, one can understand the implications of being justified and having God’s righteousness imputed only by faith.</p><p><strong>Thesis:</strong></p><p>In the letters to the Romans and the Galatians, Paul defined salvation from God’s wrath as being justified by faith, and indicated that the only way for humans to be righteous is through faith in Jesus Christ and not works of the law.</p><p><strong>I. Sin</strong></p><p>According to Paul, the cause of sin was Adam’s transgression in Eden (Rom. 5:12-21). Because of Adam’s sin the entire human race has inherited the guilt and consequences of sin. All of humanity is worthy of God’s wrath due to their sin (Rom. 1:18). There is no difference between Jew and Gentile in their guilt before God (Rom. 1:</p><p>18-3:31). Unredeemed humanity is depraved, hostile towards God and a slave to sin and death (Rom. 7:5, 8, 14-15, 19, 23-24; 8:2).</p><p>Greathouse explained, “All who have not experienced the power of God’s righteousness in the gospel are <em>hyph’ hamartian</em>, under sin” (Greathouse, 2008, p. 110). Paul is emphatic in the first three chapters of Romans that all of humanity is under the power of sin. The Mosaic Law is unable to free humanity from sin’s grip. It is only through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ that humanity can experience spiritual freedom. Greathouse adds, “The noun <em>hamartia</em> introduces the next major theme of the letter- ‘Sin’ as a personified force that took possession of the human race with Adam’s disobedience, and which rules our human existence until we appropriate God’s liberating grace offered all through ‘Jesus Christ our Lord’” (Greathouse, 2008, p. 111).</p><p>Westerholm makes this observation concerning Paul and his theology of sin: “What is clear is that when Paul speaks of the part played by sin in the lives of untransformed human beings, he is speaking not exclusively or even primarily of discrete acts of disobedience that they commit, but rather of a condition in which they find themselves, a realm or state of affairs in which they cannot choose but live” (Westerholm, 2013, pp. 37-38).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;a. The Sinner: All Humanity (Rom. 1:18-3:31) </strong></p><p>No matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile you are found to be lacking any righteousness (Rom. 3:10). Paul puts all of humanity under the umbrella of his theology of sin. Jews believed they were righteous due to being God’s chosen people and for their attempts of keeping the Mosaic Law. Paul puts this argument to rest when he says, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one” (Rom. 3:10). Greathouse adds, “Having already argued for the universality of Gentile sin and guilt, Paul appeals to the Law to clinch his argument that Jews, alongside the Gentiles, not only are accountable to God but also stand guilty before him” (Greathouse, 2008, p. 109).</p><p>Witherington makes a fine observation when he said, “Paul had already established the accountability of Gentiles to God and silenced their pretensions to moral superiority in his first argument, but here he silences Jews, showing that they are condemned out of the very source they claim gives them advantage over Gentiles. Thus is the whole world held guilty before God” (Witherington, 2004, p. 95).</p><p><strong>II. God’s Righteousness</strong></p><p>“For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed&#8211;a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ‘The righteous will live by faith’” (Rom. 1:17). God’s righteousness is a key concept in Romans and Galatians (Rom. 3:5, 21, 22, 25, 26; 10:3; Gal. 2:21; 3:21).</p><p>Vine defines righteousness (<em>dikaiosune</em>) as, “the character or quality of being right or just” (Vine, 2012, p. 530). This particular word is used to describe an attribute of God’s character in that God is right or just. Paul uses this word in Romans 3:5, “But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument).” The word “righteousness” in this context we see that God is acting in harmony with his own nature. God acts justly when he administers judgment on the unrighteousness of humanity.</p><p>When Paul uses <em>dikaiosune </em>in Romans and Galatians (Rom. 6:13, 16, 18; Gal. 2:21; 3:21) he uses it to describe the person who trusts in Jesus Christ by faith. Vines adds, “But for the most part he uses it of that gracious gift of God to men whereby all who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ are brought into right relationship with God” (Vines, 2012, p. 531).</p><p><strong>a. God’s Wrath on All Unrighteousness (Rom. 1:18)</strong></p><p>“The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness” (Rom. 1:18). It could be said that the theme of Romans is the righteousness of God. Greathouse notes, “Just as the righteousness of God means the whole situation that exists when humans are right with God, so the wrath of God means the total situations that exists when humanity turns away from the Creator” (Greathouse, 2008, p. 69).</p><p>Due to humanity’s lack of righteousness, and their ungodliness, God’s wrath is being revealed. But what does Paul mean by God’s wrath? Witherington answers succinctly, “In other words, when we think of God’s wrath we should not think of some irrational passion on the part of God, but rather of his righteous and wholly justified indignation against sinful belief and sinful behavior” (Witherington, 2004, p. 65). Sinners do not inherit the Kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21). Sinners are condemned already and await the ultimate condemnation. They are spiritually dead and await the second death. Unbelievers are currently alienated from God and will be finally excluded from his presence.</p><p>In our next lesson we will take a look at the Savior, and the solution.</p><p>(<em>This was written as a final research paper for Indiana Wesleyan University</em>)</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Greathouse, W.M., &amp; Lyons, G.

704	2016-09-25 20:53:00	\N	\N	\N	<p><strong>I want to look at the perspectives of salvation from the Gospel of John, the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul’s writings.</strong></p><p>John’s gospel was written that we might believe that Jesus was the Messiah, and by believing on Him we might attain eternal life (John 20:31). John’s gospel repeatedly teaches that one must believe in Jesus in order to escape eternal death (Schenck, p. 268). Jesus says that in order for someone to see the Kingdom of God they must be “born again” (John 3:3). Being born again wasn’t about a natural birth, but a spiritual birth. Being born again involved being born of water and Spirit (John 3:4-7). In Jesus’ words a person was saved when they had been born again of water and Spirit. Kenneth Schenck says, “What Jesus means is that one must receive the Holy Spirit in order to be a part of God’s Kingdom.” He then adds, “Jesus also alludes to the importance of Christian baptism in this chapter: one must be born of water as well as of the Spirit” (Schenck, p. 285). This message was not exclusive to the Jews, but for the whole world (John 3:16).</p><p>The Acts of the Apostles is the beginning of the Christian church. The mission of the church was to evangelize the world by beginning in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). The Apostles established the church on the message that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, which had been crucified on a cross and resurrected from the dead (Acts 2:14-36). The response to Peter’s first Christian sermon was, “They were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, ‘Men and brethren, what shall we do?’” Peter commanded them to repent of their sins, be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:37-38). Luke presents salvation in the Acts of the Apostles in like manner of John’s Gospel; that everyone is to have faith in Jesus and that in order to be considered a Christian everyone must repent and be born again. Luke connects being born of water and Spirit with Christian baptism and receiving the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 8:12, 4-16, 10:43-48, 19:1-7). The appropriate human response to the message of Jesus Christ is repentance and baptism, after which one receives the Holy Spirit (Schenck, p. 352).</p><p>Next, in Paul’s writings we see that unless you put your faith or trust in what Christ’s death had accomplished, God would destroy you on Judgment Day (Schenck, p. 422). Looking at Paul’s writings it seems that one would only have to believe in order to be saved (Rom. 1:17, Gal. 2:16, 3:11, Eph. 1:8). But, looking closely at all of his epistles, even in his ministry in Acts, Paul viewed Christian baptism and receiving the Holy Spirit as essential to being saved. Paul says that we are buried with Christ by baptism and that baptism links us to Christ’s death and resurrection, which allows us to walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:3-4). Next, Paul writes that if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not Christ’s (Rom. 8:9). The Apostle Paul’s theology of salvation did not differ from that of John’s Gospel, nor that of Luke’s account in the Acts. Finally, Paul wrote that salvation was not only for Israel, but God’s plan of redeeming mankind included the Gentiles, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek” (Rom. 1:16).</p><p><strong>Synthesis</strong></p><p>Looking at the perspectives of salvation in John’s Gospel, the Acts and Paul’s writings we see a common theme. The theme is that God sent forth His only begotten Son, made of a woman, to redeem sinners, through His atoning death on a Roman cross, and His resurrection from the dead. Through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ we can eternal life (1 Cor. 15:3-4). The response to this message was being born again by faith (John 3:3-4). I believe we can see the connection in all three perspectives. John’s perspective of salvation by believing that Jesus is the Son of God doesn’t contradict the message that the apostles preached; in fact they did preach that you had to believe to be saved (Acts 16:31). But the Acts also records where Peter commanded his listeners to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 8:12, 4-16, 10:43-48). Paul didn’t contradict his own message of justification by faith by baptizing his listeners and praying that would receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:1-6). All the elements of believing in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, repenting of your sins, being baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit mesh perfectly. “Acts presents this as the process by which one could escape God’s coming judgment” (Schenck, p. 353).</p><p>The message of salvation was the same whether you were a Jew (Acts 2:38), an unbelieving Samaritan (8:12-16), a heathen Gentile (Acts 10:44-46) or a disciple of John the Baptist (Acts 19:1-6). The Gospel is for every individual and for every generation.</p><p><strong>Application</strong></p><p>We were asked to apply our synthesis to a contemporary situation. My contemporary situation is my concern of the many modern day salvation methods. How often do we hear this same message presented in John’s Gospel, the Acts and Paul’s writings? How many different methods of salvation are currently being taught in our evangelical churches? From repeating a prayer, to lifting up a hand, to signing your name on a card, to sprinkling infants, to taking confirmation classes, and finally just shaking a preacher’s hand these methods are currently accepted as the proper process of becoming a Christian. But these are not Biblical methods.</p><p>How far have we drifted from Biblical Christianity? I believe we have drifted very far from the original means of salvation found in the Scriptures. Man-made traditions have replaced the true means of salvation. I don’t believe improper interpretation is the only issue, I believe it is a complete disregard of Scripture. We would rather please men than please God. We feel our modern day methods are more acceptable than what the first church did. I believe the application of this synthesis is simply obeying the Scripture by believing on Jesus Christ, repenting of our sins, being water baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and being filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. James wrote that we are not to be just hearers of the Word, but to be doers of the Word (James 1:22). The proper perspective of salvation is the entire Bible. We do not glean only the parts that we like, but we are to properly divide the Word of God and obey it.</p><p><em>(This essay was written as a final paper for a New Testament Survey course for Indiana Wesleyan University)</em></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p><em><u>Life Application Study Bible</u></em>.

705	2016-09-25 20:43:03	\N	\N	\N	<p>Biblical interpretation should strike fear into our heart with the realization that we are handling the very Words of the Eternal God. A God whose thoughts are not like our thoughts and whose ways are not like our ways (Isa. 55:8); a God who speaks (Matt. 4:4); The God who created the Heavens and the Earth by using words (Heb. 11:3). Understand this, that every word that He spoke had its intended purpose. When God said, “Let there be light” that is exactly what happened, light appeared (Gen 1:3). Therefore, God’s Word is intentional and has purpose (Isa. 55:11).</p><p>Hermeneutics is the science of Biblical interpretation. There is a correct way to interpret scripture and there is an incorrect way to interpret scripture. The Bible student is to be true to the text. It is not what is true to you, but what is true to the text. The Bible student is to read out of the text (Exegesis) and not into the text (Eisogesis). The belief that each of us could have our own interpretation of a particular Bible passage and that each of us is correct is called subjectivism. “Whatever you like is true for you and whatever I like is true to me.” This is what author R.C. Sproul calls subjectivism. In other words, what the Bible says is subjective to my interpretation. Truth only has one interpretation. It cannot be truth if there are multiple meanings. Then the interpretation is either true or it is false. This is why Biblical interpretation should be fearful to each of us. This is why it vitally important to interpret God’s intended purpose of every word that He has spoken.</p><p>Please keep in mind that the devil knows scripture (Matt. 4:3-11). While tempting Jesus, Satan took his liberty with interpretation and grossly took Scripture out of context. Jesus replied each time with, “It is written.” Satan attempted to single out a Bible verse and apply it to his cause. Jesus corrected Satan’s attempts by looking at how his flawed interpretation fit into the whole of scripture. We are no better than Satan when we twist and distort Scripture to fit our ideologies. We are no better than the devil when we misinterpret Scripture and take it out of context.</p><p>One must be converted before attempting to interpret the Bible. The unregenerate man is unable to discern the things of God (1 Cor. 2:14). His eyes have not yet been opened to truth. One must be filled with the Holy Spirit, for it is the Spirit that will lead us into all truth (John 16:13). However, being filled with the Spirit of God does not mean we are supernaturally enabled to know all things. Paul admonished the converted Timothy to, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). Author A.W. Tozer wrote, “The Holy Spirit never fills a man’s head. The Holy Spirit fills his heart.” The Spirit filled Bible student is to fill his mind with the Word. The Spirit filled heart will help interpret a Bible filled mind.</p><p>To be true to the text one pursues the context. Context is fundamental to Biblical interpretation. Bad theology has been built upon the vacillating foundation of incorrect contextualization. This is where many have erred throughout history, cherry picking a Biblical passage and making it a doctrine. They refuse to look at the whole counsel of the Word of God and instead choose to build their thoughts only on part of the Scriptures.</p><p>There are several actions we can take and several questions we can ask to ensure correct context. First, we must work our way out of the passage. What chapter is the verse in? What book is the chapter in? What type of book is it? Is it an historical book, a poetic book, a prophetic book, or an epistle? Who wrote this particular book of the Bible? Who were the author’s intended readers? When was this book written? How does this passage fit into the scope of scripture? Are there other texts to which I can reference? These are just a handful of questions that we must ask before we can correctly interpret a particular Bible passage. A good place to begin finding these answers is a good study Bible. Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, commentaries and handbooks are the tools that will help you mine for the vast riches of God’s Word.</p><p>Finally, beloved, one of Satan’s failed temptations in the wilderness was to entice Jesus to miraculously turn stones into bread. Let us not turn the living Bread into stone with our flawed interpretations. Instead, approach the Word of God with fear and trembling, leaning on the guidance of the Spirit to keep us true to the text.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>	100	\N	True to the Text	\N	/img_1655.jpg
706	2016-09-25 20:35:39	\N	\N	\N	<p>If one is looking to buy a Bible walking into a bookstore can be overwhelming. This is especially true in Christian bookstores. Shelves and aisles are full of different Bible translations, not to mention the specialty Bibles that range from students to hunters. Picking a Bible translation is comparable to finding a needle in the haystack.</p><p>My intention is to help one choose an English Bible. This endeavor could be compared to rushing in where angels fear to tread. The terrain of opinions on English Bible translations varies far and wide. This article is not being written to change one’s mind about, advocate nor denigrate any particular translation, but to simply guide one in making a decision. The Bible stands at the heart of the Christian faith, and a topic of such importance touches a vital part of our foundation. The intention of this article is not to poke and prod as much as it is to point and present.</p><p>Christians should not belittle any translation of the Bible. God has used various translations to bless His people and to bring people to faith in Jesus Christ. If Bible translations were a commodity, English-speaking people would be the owners of Bibles on a thousand hills. However, not all English Bibles are created equal. If there were a choice between not having any translation and having an inferior translation, I would choose the inferior translation. If Christians are reading the Bible then we have succeeded. I do not believe anyone could argue that less people need to read the Bible in America. If anything we need more people reading the Bible regardless of which English translation they prefer. Biblical illiteracy is rampant in our culture, and nowhere is that more visible than the church pew.</p><p>It is good to keep in mind that the Word of God is infallible; translators of the Word of God are not infallible. God used fallible men to write His Word, and He has used fallible men to translate and publish His Word. The Author and His Word are perfect, but there is not a perfect language and there is not a perfect translation. However, we are not without hope. Thankfully, God has blessed us with many wonderful English translations that are more than adequate.</p><p>When choosing a Bible translation it is important to make a well-informed decision, not one based upon emotion, marketing, or tradition. Instead, there are a few basic principles to keep in mind as one make a decision.</p><p><strong><u>Inspiration</u></strong></p><p>Scripture is inspired of God (2 Tim. 3:16, 2 Peter 1:21). Inspiration speaks of the original writing process and text. Additionally, the Divine inspiration does not extend to the efforts to copy and translate the original texts. The original texts were written in Hebrew in the Old Testament, and Greek and Aramaic in the New Testament. Although we do not have the original manuscripts, we can rightly affirm that the copies and translations that we do have are accurate representations. This does not mean we do not have the Word of God today. It simply means that we do not accredit any errors to textual transmission to the original manuscripts, which were inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p><p><strong><u>Word for Word</u></strong></p><p>When studying the Bible it is good to use a more <em>literal translation</em>. Since the majority of Christians do not know Hebrew and Greek we have to settle for a more literal English translation. Scholars tend to call this a “<em>word for word</em>” translation. A good literal translation endeavors to translate the original text word for word without sacrificing proper English grammar. Word for word translations are very useful for in depth Bible study.</p><p>Versions such as the New American Standard Bible, the King James Version and the English Standard Version are just a few of the excellent choices for a more word for word translation. When choosing one of these versions it is good to consider their readability. Some are easier to read than others, and others may be more difficult.</p><p><strong><u>Thought for Thought</u></strong></p><p>There are translations considered “<em>thought for thought</em>” also called <em>dynamic equivalency</em>. By definition, the translators attempt to balance literal translation and idiomatic readability. Meaning, the translation is much easier to read. The translators are concerned with the accuracy of the translation and also weigh the <em>intended</em> <em>thought</em> of the original biblical writer. Translators of <em>thought for thought</em> translations take a little more liberty to make frequent modifications to make the biblical writer’s <em>thought</em> clearer.</p><p>If one is looking for a Bible that does not sacrifice accuracy but is much easier to read then the New International Version, New Century Version and New Living Translation are excellent places to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/bible-transchrt.jpgresize=800%2C186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" alt="bible-transchrt" width="800" height="186"></p><p>(<em>Image from OliveTree.com</em>)</p><p><strong><u>Paraphrase </u></strong></p><p>Finally, there are <em>paraphrase</em> Bibles. Technically, a <em>paraphrase</em> is not a translation of the original languages. A <em>paraphrase</em> is a restatement of a text or passage giving the meaning in another form. The <em>paraphrase</em> Bibles have become quite popular the last few decades due to their modern vernacular and accessibility. The purpose of the paraphrase is to clarify meaning in a text. A paraphrase Bible is trying to communicate God’s message in a very clear modern language. However, modern vernacular in paraphrase Bibles cloud theological truths.</p><p>Paraphrase Bibles have their place in Christian reading. However, paraphrase Bibles are not recommended for serious Bible study due to their attempts to explain the text rather than translate the original text. This results in the paraphrase adding or taking away from the original text for the sake of readability. The Living Bible and the Message are examples of paraphrase Bibles.</p><p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p><p>Christians should be students of the Bible. The study of God’s Word is profitable for doctrine, reproof, and correction and in training for righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16-17). The same type of study and research should go into finding the most suitable English translation for your personal study and devotions.</p><p>God has graciously given to us His Word, and God in His sovereignty has used many different translations to build His church. The Word of God has adequately communicated in various English translations the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and for this we should be thankful. We should be grateful that we have many translations at our fingertips, while there are many countries with people who do not have a translation of the Bible that they can understand.</p><p>It is better to have people, especially Christians, read a weak translation of the Bible than not to read the Bible at all. God can use any version to bless people. The worst kind of Bible is a neglected Bible. God forbid that we would neglect to read and study the Bible while we have such an abundance of riches</p><p>&nbsp;</p>	100	\N	Choosing a Bible Translation	\N	/img_1657.jpg
